| Continuous Integration (CI)           | - Regularly merging code changes into a shared repository. <br> - Automated building and testing to detect issues early.                                                |
| Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)   | - Automating the release process to deploy code changes efficiently. <br> - Ensuring software is always in a deployable state.                                          |
| Version Control Management            | - Using systems like Git to track code changes. <br> - Facilitating collaboration among developers.                                                                    |
| Automated Testing                     | - Implementing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. <br> - Ensuring code quality and reducing defects in production.                                                 |
| Collaboration and Communication Tools | - Utilizing platforms like Jira or Trello for project management. <br> - Encouraging cross-team collaboration to align development and operations.                      |
| **Infrastructure Operations**         |                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC)          | - Managing infrastructure using code with tools like Terraform or CloudFormation. <br> - Enabling consistent and repeatable environment setups.                        |
| Configuration Management              | - Automating system configurations using Ansible, Puppet, or Chef. <br> - Maintaining consistency across servers and environments.                                       |
| Containerization and Orchestration    | - Using Docker to containerize applications for consistency. <br> - Employing Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for container orchestration.                                   |
| Monitoring and Logging                | - Implementing tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack. <br> - Monitoring system performance and analyzing logs proactively.                                        |
| Continuous Security (DevSecOps)       | - Integrating security practices into the DevOps workflow. <br> - Automating security checks and compliance validations.                                                |
| Automated Provisioning and Scaling    | - Using scripts and tools to automate resource provisioning. <br> - Implementing autoscaling policies to handle variable loads.                                         |
| Cloud Services Management             | - Leveraging cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP for scalable infrastructure. <br> - Managing resources efficiently to optimize cost and performance.                 |
| Disaster Recovery and Backup         | - Implementing strategies for data backup and recovery. <br> - Ensuring business continuity in case of failures.                                                        |
