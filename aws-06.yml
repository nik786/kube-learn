Comparing Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda for a cost-effective, highly available, and 
scalable infrastructure cloud environment involves considering their respective pros and cons:

Amazon EC2:

Pros:

Flexibility and Control: EC2 instances provide full control over the underlying infrastructure, 
allowing you to customize instance types, 
operating systems, networking, and storage configurations.
Support for Legacy Applications: Suitable for migrating and running legacy applications that 
require long-running processes or specific environment configurations.
Predictable Costs: Pricing for EC2 instances is based on hourly usage, making it predictable 
for steady-state workloads with consistent resource requirements.
Scalability: With Auto Scaling, you can automatically scale EC2 capacity based on demand, 
ensuring availability and performance during peak usage periods.
Supports Diverse Workloads: Suitable for a wide range of workloads, including long-running 
applications, batch processing, and stateful applications.


Cons:

Management Overhead: Requires manual management of infrastructure, including provisioning, 
patching, monitoring, and scaling.
Cost Overruns: If not properly managed, costs can escalate due to underutilized resources, 
idle instances, or overprovisioning.
Higher Operational Complexity: Operating and managing EC2 instances requires expertise in 
infrastructure management, DevOps practices, and security best practices.
Potential for Downtime: Instances may experience downtime due to hardware failures, 
software issues, or maintenance activities, 
requiring proactive monitoring and redundancy to maintain availability.


AWS Lambda:

Pros:

Serverless Architecture: No need to manage servers or infrastructure, as AWS Lambda automatically 
provisions and scales resources based on workload demands.
Pay-Per-Use Pricing: Lambda functions are billed based on the number of requests and the duration of execution, leading to 
cost savings for sporadic or event-driven workloads.
Automatic Scaling: Scales automatically in response to incoming requests, ensuring availability 
and performance without manual intervention.
Event-Driven Architecture: Ideal for event-driven or asynchronous workloads, such as real-time data processing, 
file processing, or IoT applications.
Built-In High Availability: Runs across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region, providing 
built-in redundancy and fault tolerance.


Cons:

Cold Start Latency: Cold starts may introduce latency for the first invocation of a function or 
after periods of inactivity, impacting 
performance for time-sensitive applications.
Limited Execution Time and Resources: Lambda functions have execution time limits (currently 
15 minutes per invocation) and memory limits (up to 10 GB), 
which may not be suitable for long-running or resource-intensive tasks.
Vendor Lock-In: Adopting Lambda may result in vendor lock-in, as functions are tightly 
integrated with AWS services and may require re-architecture 
to migrate to other platforms.
Stateless Execution: Functions are stateless by design, limiting their suitability for 
applications with complex state management 
or long-running transactions.
Debugging and Monitoring Challenges: Debugging and monitoring Lambda functions can be challenging compared to 
traditional application architectures, requiring specialized tools and techniques.



Which one is better depends on your specific use case, requirements, and constraints. 
For event-driven, stateless, and 
sporadic workloads with unpredictable traffic patterns, AWS Lambda may offer cost savings, scalability, and simplicity. 
However, for workloads requiring fine-grained control, long-running processes, or legacy applications, 
Amazon EC2 provides greater flexibility and customization options.

 Ultimately, it's essential to evaluate your workload characteristics, 
 performance requirements, budget considerations, 
 and operational preferences when choosing 
 between EC2 and Lambda for your infrastructure environment.
