| Describe a time when you had to analyze a large amount of data to make a decision. What was your process and what was the result?     | I analyzed a large dataset to optimize resource allocation for a high-traffic e-commerce platform. I defined objectives, cleaned data, performed exploratory data analysis, and identified patterns. Using a predictive model, I recommended adding a Redis cache, scaling EC2 instances dynamically, and using CloudFront to segment traffic. This reduced response times by 40%, increased availability by 30%, and cut resource costs by 20%.                                                                                       |
| Have you ever been in a situation where you had to admit to making a mistake? How did you handle it?                                   | During a patching operation, I approved a change without adequate testing, causing downtime. I acknowledged the mistake, collaborated to restore services, and conducted a root cause analysis. Implementing stricter change management policies and better pre-production environments prevented future issues. By taking responsibility and being transparent, I regained trust and improved processes, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.                                                                 |
| Can you provide an example of when you had to support a team member who was struggling with their tasks? What did you do?             | A junior engineer struggled with Jenkins pipeline scripting due to inexperience with Groovy. I identified their challenges, provided immediate guidance, shared resources, and broke down tasks into manageable milestones. Weekly check-ins and encouraging collaboration helped them gain confidence. They improved significantly, delivering quality work on time. This support enhanced both individual growth and team efficiency.                                                                                                           |
