|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Proactive Monitoring**     | Configured observability stacks with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack to detect issues early.                                                                                     |
| **Automation**               | Automated resource provisioning, scaling, and backups using Terraform, AWS Lambda, and CI/CD pipelines.                                                                             |
| **Standardized Practices**   | Enforced coding standards, tagging policies, and modular IaC to maintain consistency across environments.                                                                            |
| **Capacity Planning**        | Analyzed historical metrics and conducted load testing to plan resource allocation for peak periods.                                                                                |
| **Feedback Loops**           | Collected feedback post-deployment and incorporated insights into future processes to improve continuously.                                                                         |
| **Incident Preparedness**    | Maintained detailed runbooks for on-call engineers to address common incidents and reduce resolution times.                                                                          |

By addressing challenges systematically and fostering collaboration, I ensured resource and infrastructure management aligned with organizational
goals while providing a seamless experience for teams and users.
