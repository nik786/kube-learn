# 🚀 Transformer-10: Text Summarization & Commentary with Flan-T5  

## 📌 Summary of the Code  
This script integrates **Hugging Face Transformers** with **LangChain** to perform two key NLP tasks:  

- **📝 Summarization**  
  Converts complex political or legal questions into simple, layman-friendly summaries.  

- **💬 Critical Commentary**  
  Analyzes political context and explains background for **non-US residents**.  

🔧 **Model Used**: `google/flan-t5-base` – a lightweight, CPU-optimized **Seq2Seq** model.  
🔗 **Pipeline**: Built with Hugging Face `pipeline`, wrapped into **LangChain’s LLMChain** for flexible prompt chaining.

## ✅ Suggested Improvements  

1. **⚡ Batch Inference Support**  
   Enable multiple questions/contexts to be processed in a single run for efficiency.  

2. **📂 Result Storage**  
   Store outputs (summaries & commentary) in structured formats like **JSON/CSV** instead of console-only output.  

3. **🎭 Dynamic Prompt Selection**  
   Allow switching between multiple templates (summarization, sentiment, Q&A) dynamically.  

4. **🛠 Error Handling & Logging**  
   Add `try-except` blocks with detailed logging to gracefully handle model loading or inference errors.  

5. **📊 Evaluation Metrics**  
   Integrate **ROUGE/BLEU** for summaries and **perplexity** for generated text to measure quality.

## 🚀 Alternative Approaches & Models  

### 1. `google/flan-t5-large`  
- ✅ More powerful and accurate version of Flan-T5.  
- ⚠️ Requires more memory, slower on CPU.  

### 2. `facebook/bart-large-cnn`  
- ✅ Strong summarization model fine-tuned on **CNN/DailyMail** dataset.  
- ⚠️ Specialized for summarization, less flexible for multi-tasking.  

### 3. `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` (quantized)  
- ✅ Instruction-tuned model with high-quality contextual reasoning.  
- ⚠️ Requires **GPU or CPU quantization** (`bitsandbytes`) for smooth local runs.
