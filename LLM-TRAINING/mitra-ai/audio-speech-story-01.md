Audio-to-Summary Pipeline (audio-speech-01.py)

This script builds an end-to-end pipeline that:

Downloads YouTube audio

Transcribes speech → text using Whisper

Summarizes & interprets with Groq’s Llama-3 (70B)

🔹 Purpose

Convert YouTube videos → transcripts → concise summaries using speech recognition + LLMs.

🔹 Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. 🎤 Whisper Setup

Loads OpenAI’s Whisper
 model.

Default: tiny (fast, lightweight).

Options: medium, large for higher accuracy.

Task: Convert YouTube audio → transcript.

2. 🧠 Groq LLM Setup

Reads GROQ_API_KEY from environment variables.

Initializes ChatGroq with model: llama3-70b-8192.

Task: Summarize and interpret transcripts.

3. 📥 YouTube Audio Processing (summarize_yt)

Accepts a YouTube URL.

Downloads audio via pytubefix.

(Optional) Previews audio in Jupyter (IPython Audio).

Transcribes with Whisper → plain text.

Sends transcript to LLM with instruction:

“Guess the movie and provide the context.”

Returns summary response.

4. 📚 Batch Processing

Runs pipeline on 3 sample YouTube URLs.

For each video:

Prints raw transcript.

Prints Groq LLM summary.

🔹 In Short

The script acts as a YouTube audio summarizer:

Input → YouTube Link

Process → Download → Transcribe (Whisper) → Summarize (Groq Llama-3)

Output → Contextual summary (movie + storyline)

🔹 5 Improvements

Error Handling & Validation

Catch broken links, missing audio, failed downloads.

Wrap transcription + LLM calls in try/except.

Configurable Models

Expose Whisper + LLM model via CLI args/env vars.

Allow easy switching (speed vs accuracy).

Streaming Transcription

Process long videos in chunks.

Provide partial transcripts for real-time summarization.

Caching & Reuse

Save transcripts locally (SQLite/JSON).

Avoid re-processing the same video multiple times.

Smarter Prompts

Instead of only “Guess the movie”, allow:

Summarize in 3 bullet points.

Explain for kids (age 10).

Create quiz questions.

🔹 Use Cases

Media Analysis

Identify movies, shows, or songs from clips.

Summarize their context.

Educational Summaries

Convert lectures/tutorials into notes or flashcards.

Podcasts & Meetings

Generate concise summaries from long discussions.

Searchable Video Archive

Store transcripts in a vector DB (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate).

Enable semantic search (e.g., “Find videos where Kubernetes is explained”).

Accessibility

Provide transcripts + summaries for deaf/hard of hearing users.

Make media more inclusive.

✅ In summary:
