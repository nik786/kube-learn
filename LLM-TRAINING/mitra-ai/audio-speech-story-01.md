Audio-to-Summary Pipeline (audio-speech-01.py)

This script builds an end-to-end pipeline that:

👉 Downloads YouTube audio
👉 Transcribes speech to text with Whisper
👉 Summarizes & interprets with Groq’s Llama-3 (70B)

🔹 Purpose

Convert YouTube videos → transcripts → concise summaries using a combination of speech recognition + LLMs.

🔹 Step-by-Step Breakdown
🎤 Whisper Setup

Loads OpenAI’s Whisper
 model.

Default: tiny (fast, lightweight).

Can upgrade to medium or large for higher accuracy.

Converts YouTube audio → text transcript.

🧠 Groq LLM Setup

Reads GROQ_API_KEY from environment variables.

Initializes ChatGroq with llama3-70b-8192.

Used for summarizing and interpreting transcripts.

📥 YouTube Audio Processing (summarize_yt)

Takes a YouTube URL.

Downloads audio via pytubefix.

Optionally previews audio in Jupyter (IPython Audio).

Runs Whisper → generates transcript.

Sends transcript to LLM with prompt:

“Guess the movie and provide the context”

Returns LLM’s summary response.

📚 Batch Processing

Script runs on 3 sample YouTube URLs.

For each video:

Prints raw transcript.

Prints Groq LLM summary.

🔹 In Short

This script is a YouTube audio summarizer:

Input   → YouTube Link  
Process → Download → Transcribe (Whisper) → Summarize (Groq Llama-3)  
Output  → Contextual summary (e.g., movie + storyline)

🔹 5 Improvements

Error Handling & Validation

Gracefully handle broken links, missing audio, failed downloads.

Wrap transcription + LLM calls in try/except.

Configurable Models

Expose Whisper + LLM model choices via CLI args or env vars.

Easily switch between speed (tiny) vs accuracy (large).

Streaming Transcription

Process audio in chunks for faster turnaround.

Provide partial transcripts to LLM in real-time.

Caching & Reuse

Save transcripts locally (SQLite/JSON).

Avoid re-downloading + re-transcribing the same video.

Smarter Prompts

Current: “Guess the movie and provide the context.”

Alternatives:

“Summarize in 3 bullet points.”

“Explain as if to a 10-year-old.”

“Generate quiz questions from content.”

🔹 Use Cases
🎥 Media Analysis

Identify movies, shows, songs from clips and summarize their context.

🎓 Educational Summaries

Transcribe lectures, tutorials, talks → generate study notes or flashcards.

🎙️ Podcasts & Meetings

Turn long conversations into concise, actionable summaries.

🔍 Searchable Video Archive

Store transcripts in a vector DB (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate).

Enable semantic search:

“Find all videos where Kubernetes is explained.”

♿ Accessibility

Provide transcripts + summaries for people who are deaf/hard of hearing.

Makes media content more inclusive.

✅ In short:
Your script is a video/audio → transcript → summary pipeline, useful for knowledge extraction, searchable archives, accessibility, and learning.
