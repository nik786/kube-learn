# ðŸš€ Transformer-21: Multi-Functional LLM Workflow with OPT  

## ðŸ“Œ Summary of the Code  
This script integrates **Hugging Face OPT (facebook/opt-350m)** with **LangChain** to build a multi-purpose pipeline:  

- **ðŸ”¹ Summarization Chain**  
  Uses `PromptTemplate` to generate simplified summaries for laymen.  

- **ðŸ”¹ Political Context Commentary**  
  Provides critical commentary and background analysis of political events for non-US audiences.  

- **ðŸ”¹ Python Code Generator + REPL Execution**  
  - Prompts the LLM to generate Python code in Markdown format.  
  - Cleans output via a `sanitize` function.  
  - Executes safely in a **silent Python REPL** with error handling.  

The model (`facebook/opt-350m`) is lightweight (~1.3GB RAM) and runs efficiently for testing and educational workflows.

## âœ… Suggested Improvements  

1. **Switch to `max_new_tokens` instead of `max_length`**  
   - Prevents input truncation issues when prompts are long.  

2. **Add Structured Output Parsing**  
   - Use `PydanticOutputParser` or JSON schema for summaries and commentary.  

3. **Improve REPL Safety**  
   - Add sandboxing or timeouts to prevent long-running or malicious code execution.  

4. **Caching & Reuse**  
   - Integrate `langchain.cache` to avoid regenerating the same summaries and commentary repeatedly.  

5. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering**  
   - Use few-shot examples in prompts for more reliable summarization and commentary results.

## ðŸ”„ Alternative Approaches & Models  

1. **FLAN-T5 (Googleâ€™s Instruction-Tuned Model)**  
   - Use `google/flan-t5-base` or `flan-t5-large` for better summarization and reasoning.  

2. **LLaMA 2 (Meta)**  
   - Use `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` for stronger commentary and reasoning, especially in political contexts.  

3. **Mistral 7B (Efficient Transformer)**  
   - Use `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` for a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and reasoning power.
