PDF Parsing and Visualization Script
📌 Summary

This script integrates pdf2image, matplotlib, and unstructured.partition.pdf to process and extract structured data from PDFs.

📑 PDF to Image Conversion

Uses pdf2image.convert_from_path to convert each page of a PDF (arso.pdf) into high-resolution images.

📊 Structured Partitioning

Leverages partition_pdf from the unstructured library to detect and classify document elements (Tables, Images, etc.).

📋 Table Extraction

Extracts detected tables, prints the first table in HTML format, and makes it usable for structured data analysis.

🖼️ Image Detection & Cropping

Detects images from PDF pages, crops them with padding, and displays them using matplotlib.

🎯 Output

Displays cropped tables and images for inspection and potential downstream tasks (OCR, analysis, ML preprocessing).

🔧 Suggested Improvements

Error Handling & Logging

Add exception handling (e.g., missing files, parsing errors) and log outputs for debugging.

Save Extracted Data

Store cropped images and HTML tables into output folders instead of only displaying them.

Batch Processing

Extend the script to handle multiple PDFs in a directory.

Table Post-processing

Integrate pandas to convert HTML tables into DataFrame objects for direct CSV/Excel export.

Efficiency Enhancements

Implement multiprocessing for parallel image extraction and cropping to speed up processing on large PDFs.

🚀 Alternative Approaches & Models

Camelot / Tabula

Use Camelot-py or Tabula-py for advanced table extraction with CSV/JSON export options.

LayoutLM / LayoutLMv3 (Hugging Face)

Apply transformer-based document layout models to jointly process text + structure (useful for OCR + classification).

PaddleOCR + DocAI

Combine PaddleOCR (for robust text/image detection) with Google Document AI for enterprise-grade parsing.
