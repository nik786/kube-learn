# Multi-Pipeline NLP with Hugging Face Transformers

## Summary of the Code
This script demonstrates the use of multiple Hugging Face `transformers` pipelines for different **NLP tasks**.  
Key points:  

- **Zero-Shot Classification**  
  Uses `typeform/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli` for classifying text without task-specific training.  

- **Summarization**  
  Uses `Falconsai/text_summarization` to condense a long corporate profile of **Shell** into a shorter summary.  

- **Feature Extraction**  
  Uses `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` to generate embeddings for semantic understanding (average-pooled vector representation).  

- **Question Answering (QA)**  
  Uses `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` to extract answers from context passages (example: identifying Eknath Shinde as CM of Maharashtra).  

The script highlights how different pipelines can be combined in a single workflow for varied NLP applications.

## âœ… Suggested Improvements
1. **Automatic Device Detection**  
   Use GPU if available for faster inference:  
   ```python
   device = 0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1 ```

2. **Batch Processing**
Process multiple documents/questions at once instead of running sequentially for efficiency.

3. **Unified Output Handling**
Export results from all pipelines (summarization, QA, embeddings) into a single structured JSON/CSV file.

4. **Error Handling & Logging**
Add try-except blocks and logging for robustness in production workflows.

5. **Configurable Pipelines
Allow switching models via configuration or CLI arguments for easier experimentation.

##Alternative Approaches & Models

  1. Larger & More Accurate Summarization
   Model: facebook/bart-large-cnn

     - Why: High accuracy abstractive summarizer, widely used for news & reports.
     - Trade-off: Slower inference, requires more memory.

  2. Advanced Embedding Model
     - Model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
     - Why: Lightweight, fast embeddings suitable for semantic search & clustering.
     - Trade-off: Slightly less accurate than larger models but faster in production.

  3. Stronger Question Answering

     - Model: google/electra-base-squad2 or allenai/unifiedqa-t5-base
     - Why: More robust for QA tasks across diverse domains.
     - Trade-off: Larger compute requirements compared to roberta-base-squad2.
