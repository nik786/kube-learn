Transformer-08: Text Generation with Flan-T5-Small
ðŸ“Œ Summary

This script showcases text-to-text generation using Googleâ€™s Flan-T5-Small model via Hugging Face transformers.

Loads the google/flan-t5-small model and tokenizer.

Creates a pipeline for text2text-generation.

Runs completely on CPU (device=-1) for laptop-friendly inference.

Generates a short story based on a given prompt (dragon and a cat example).

ðŸ”§ 5 Improvements

Enable quantization for CPU efficiency

Use torch_dtype="auto" and low_cpu_mem_usage=True to reduce memory footprint.

Support multiple prompts in one run

Batch input texts to save processing time.

Add error handling and logging

Catch invalid input or model loading issues gracefully.

Store results automatically

Write outputs to .txt or .csv for reuse.

Tune generation parameters

Expose max_new_tokens, temperature, and top_p for customizable creativity.

ðŸŒŸ 3 Better Alternative Approaches & Models

google/flan-t5-base

Slightly larger model, improved reasoning and output quality while still lightweight.

tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct (with quantization)

Stronger instruction-following; quantization helps run on CPU laptops.

HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha

Aligned for chat-like, creative, and instruction-heavy tasks.
