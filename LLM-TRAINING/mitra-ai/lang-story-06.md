# LangChain + Groq + Chroma + SQLite Pipeline

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
- Uses **Groq LLMs** (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile` with fallbacks) for text generation.  
- Connects to a local **SQLite database** (`worldevents.db`) and fetches event data.  
- Converts database rows into **LangChain Documents**.  
- Creates embeddings with **HuggingFace all-MiniLM-L6-v2** (lightweight, CPU-friendly).  
- Stores embeddings in **Chroma vector database** with persistence.  
- Defines a **retrieval QA chain** for answering natural language questions.  
- Defines a **SQL generation chain** to auto-generate and run queries against the SQLite DB.  
- Includes **fallback mechanism** in case the primary Groq model is decommissioned.

## ðŸš€ Improvements
1. **Persistent Vector Store Handling**  
   - Instead of wiping (`shutil.rmtree`) every run, support incremental updates to Chroma.  

2. **Structured Citations**  
   - Format citations in a consistent JSON/Markdown structure for downstream use.  

3. **Error Handling for SQL Queries**  
   - Add guards for invalid SQL, empty results, or schema mismatches.  

4. **Batch Embedding**  
   - Use batched embedding to improve speed when dealing with large datasets.  

5. **Logging & Monitoring**  
   - Add structured logging (e.g., `loguru`) to trace LLM calls, failures, and query results.

## ðŸ”„ Better Alternatives
1. **Vector DB**  
   - Use **FAISS** (faster, memory-efficient, good for local prototyping) instead of Chroma.  

2. **Embedding Model**  
   - Upgrade to **BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5** for better semantic search performance at low cost.  

3. **LLM Provider**  
   - Add support for **Ollama** (local models) or **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** (if cloud access is acceptable).

Hereâ€™s why:

Retriever step: You take event data from worldevents.db, embed it with HuggingFace embeddings, and store it in Chroma.

Retriever call: In the chain, you call

"context": lambda x: vector_db.as_retriever().get_relevant_documents(x)


â†’ this pulls relevant chunks (documents) from the vector DB.

LLM step: Those retrieved docs are passed into Groq LLM (ChatGroq) together with the question, and the model uses them to craft the answer.

Thatâ€™s the classic RAG pipeline:

Retrieve context from vector DB.

Augment user query with retrieved context.

Generate a detailed answer using the LLM.

The second half of your code (SQL chain) is more like Text-to-SQL generation, not strictly RAG, but complements the retrieval by allowing structured queries over the same DB.
