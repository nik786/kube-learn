# Summary of `llm-22.py`

# Project Summary (`llm-22.py`)

## ðŸ”¹ What the Script Does
1. Connects to a **SQLite database** (`worldevents.db`) and retrieves stored event data.  
2. Converts each database record into a **LangChain Document** object.  
3. Uses **`SentenceTransformerEmbeddings`** with the model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to generate embeddings.  
4. Stores embeddings in a **persistent Chroma vector database** for retrieval.  
5. Performs a **similarity search query** (e.g., `"conflicts involving UK"`) to find the most relevant events.  
6. Prints search results along with event details such as **place** and **type of event**.

## ðŸ”¹ 5 Improvements

1. **Use context managers for DB connections**  
   Replace manual `connect`/`cursor` with `with sql.connect(db_path) as conn:` to ensure clean closure of resources.

2. **Parameterize queries**  
   Future-proof against SQL injection and improve maintainability by using parameterized SQL queries.

3. **Structured logging**  
   Replace `print` with Pythonâ€™s `logging` module for better debugging, error tracing, and log levels.

4. **Configurable settings**  
   Move paths (`worldevents.db`, `chroma_db`) and model name (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) into a config file or environment variables for easier portability.

5. **Evaluation & testing**  
   Add unit tests for data loading, embedding generation, and similarity queries to ensure robustness when the dataset grows.

## ðŸ”¹ Better Alternative Embedding Models

1. **`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2`**  
   - Slightly larger than L6, better performance on semantic similarity.  
   - Still lightweight and CPU-friendly.  

2. **`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`**  
   - Modern embedding model, optimized for retrieval tasks.  
   - Good balance between speed and accuracy.  

3. **`intfloat/multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`**  
   - Supports multiple languages beyond English.  
   - Useful if the dataset includes global events in non-English text.

âœ… Current choice (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) is best for lightweight, CPU-only setups.  
If accuracy and multilingual capability matter more than speed, consider alternatives above.
