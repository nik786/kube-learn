# ðŸ“˜ Summary of `llm-24.py`

## ðŸ”¹ What the Script Does
1. **SQLite Setup** â€“ Patches Pythonâ€™s default `sqlite3` with `pysqlite3` for better compatibility.  
2. **Secure API Key Handling** â€“ Reads the Groq API key from environment variables (no hardcoding).  
3. **Model Selection with Fallback** â€“ Uses `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` as the preferred model, and automatically retries with smaller Groq-supported models (`llama3-8b-8192`, `mixtral-8x7b-32768`) if the first is decommissioned.  
4. **Embeddings Setup** â€“ Uses `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` embeddings via `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` on CPU, stored in a persistent Chroma vector database.  
5. **Prompt Template & QA Chain** â€“ Builds a retrieval QA chain that:  
   - Retrieves relevant documents,  
   - Passes them into a custom prompt,  
   - Calls Groq LLM for detailed answers with citations,  
   - Returns the formatted response.  
6. **Execution** â€“ Runs a query (`"conflicts involving UK"`) and prints the final structured answer.

## ðŸ”§ Suggested Improvements
1. **Remove Deprecation Warnings**  
   Replace `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` and `Chroma` imports with their updated packages:  
   ```python
   from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
   from langchain_chroma import Chroma
Add Logging & Error Handling
Use Pythonâ€™s logging instead of raw print() for clearer debug information and error tracing.

Parameterized Queries
Allow the user to pass different queries from the command line (e.g., python llm-23.py "impact of wars in Asia").

Citation Formatting
Improve citation handling by normalizing and deduplicating references before printing.

Modularize Code
Split into separate modules:

db_utils.py (database helpers),

llm_chain.py (LLM pipeline setup),

main.py (execution).

ðŸš€ Better Alternatives (Models/Approaches)
Groq + llama3-8b-8192 â€“ Smaller and faster, suitable for quick prototyping with lower cost.

Mistral (mixtral-8x7b-32768) â€“ Strong balance of efficiency and reasoning, available on Groq.

Local Lightweight Models â€“ Use sentence-transformers + llama.cpp quantized models for offline retrieval QA (cheaper, private, but less powerful than Groq cloud models).
