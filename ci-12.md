Question 11: On a daily basis, what type of automation do you work on?


# Daily Automation Tasks

On a daily basis, I focus on various automation tasks across different areas:

## CI/CD Pipeline Automation
- Develop pipelines for building, testing, and deploying applications using **Jenkins** and **GitLab CI**.
- Integrate automated testing to ensure code quality and smooth deployments.

## Infrastructure Automation
- Use **Terraform** to provision cloud resources (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Employ **Ansible** for configuration management across different environments, ensuring consistency.

## Containerization Automation
- Automate **Docker** image builds and container deployments to maintain consistency.
- Use **Kubernetes** manifests and **Helm** charts for managing container orchestration and deployments.

## Scripting and Task Automation
- Write **Python** and **Bash** scripts for routine tasks like log rotation, backups, and environment clean-ups.
- Schedule automated jobs using **cron** to handle regular maintenance tasks.

## Monitoring and Alerting Automation
- Configure **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for automated metric collection and visualization.
- Set up alerts to notify the team of system anomalies or performance degradation.

## Security Automation
- Integrate **security scanning tools** into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities.
- Automate **compliance checks** to maintain security standards and ensure industry best practices.

By automating these tasks, I help reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and enhance efficiency, allowing the team to focus on delivering value faster and more reliably.
