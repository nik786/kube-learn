## How do I update my worker nodes?
AWS publishes EKS-optimized Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that include the necessary worker node binaries (Docker and Kubelet). This AMI is updated regularly and includes the most up-to-date version of these components. You can update your EKS managed nodes to the latest versions of the EKS-optimized AMIs with a single command in the EKS console, API, or CLI.

If you are building your own custom AMIs for EKS worker nodes, AWS also publishes Packer scripts that document the build steps, allowing you to identify the binaries included in each version of the AMI.

---

## How much does Amazon EKS cost?
- You pay **$0.10 per hour** for each Amazon EKS cluster you create.
- You also pay for the AWS resources you create to run your Kubernetes worker nodes.
- You only pay for what you use, as you use itâ€”**no minimum fees and no upfront commitments**.

---

## Can I update my Kubernetes cluster to a new version?
Yes, Amazon EKS performs managed, in-place cluster upgrades for both Kubernetes and Amazon EKS platform versions. This simplifies cluster operations and lets you take advantage of the latest Kubernetes features, as well as updates to Amazon EKS configuration and security patches.

There are two types of updates you can apply to your Amazon EKS cluster:
1. **Kubernetes version updates**
2. **Amazon EKS platform version updates**

As new Kubernetes versions are released and validated for use with Amazon EKS, we will support **three stable Kubernetes versions** at any given time as part of the update process.

---

## What happens when pods die unexpectedly? Does EKS automatically restart them?
When pods die unexpectedly, EKS **does not automatically restart them**. Instead, it is up to the user to configure their own pod restart policies. This can be done using the kubeletâ€™s `--pod-infra-container-image` flag, which allows you to specify the image that will be used for the podâ€™s infrastructure container.

---

## What are the key components involved with Amazon EKS setup?
The key components involved in setting up Amazon EKS are:
- **Amazon EKS control plane**: Manages the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Amazon EKS worker nodes**: The servers that run the applications and services within the cluster.

# Connecting Amazon S3 Bucket to EKS Cluster
-------------------------------------------------

This guide outlines the steps to connect an Amazon S3 bucket to an Amazon EKS cluster and mount it using the Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver.

---

### 1. **Create an Amazon EKS Cluster**
---------------------------------------------

   - Set up an Amazon EKS cluster using the AWS Console, CLI, or `eksctl`.

---

### 2. **Create Amazon S3 Buckets**
-------------------------------------------

   - Create one or more Amazon S3 buckets where you want to store and access data from within your EKS cluster.

---

### 3. **Create an IAM Policy to Allow Access to S3 Buckets**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

   - Create an IAM policy to grant permissions for accessing the S3 buckets:
     ```bash
     aws iam create-policy --policy-name "aws-s3-mountpoint-policy" --policy-document file://iam-policy.json
     ```

   - The `iam-policy.json` file should contain the necessary permissions for accessing your S3 bucket.

---

### 4. **Create an IAM OIDC Provider for the EKS Cluster**
-------------------------------------------------------------

   - Get the OIDC issuer URL for your EKS cluster:
     ```bash
     aws eks describe-cluster --name <cluster_name> --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" --output text
     ```

   - List the OIDC providers to confirm the provider ID:
     ```bash
     aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers | grep <EXAMPLE_ID>
     ```

   - Associate the IAM OIDC provider with your EKS cluster:
     ```bash
     eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster <cluster_name> --approve
     ```

---

### 5. **Create an IAM Role and Service Account**
---------------------------------------------------

   - Create an IAM service account and attach the necessary policy for the S3 mount:
     ```bash
     eksctl create iamserviceaccount --name s3-mount-sa --namespace s3-mount --cluster <cluster_name> --role-name <role_name> --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/aws-s3-mountpoint-policy --approve
     ```

---

### 6. **Install Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI Driver**
----------------------------------------------------------

   - Deploy the Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver to your cluster to allow mounting S3 buckets to EKS pods.

---

### 7. **Deploy a Sample Application with S3 Mount**
-------------------------------------------------------

   - Create a sample pod configuration to mount the S3 bucket:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: s3-mount-pod-02
       namespace: s3-mount
     spec:
       serviceAccountName: s3-mount-sa
       hostNetwork: true
       containers:
       - name: app
         image: amazonlinux
         command: ["/bin/sh"]
         args: ["-c", "while true; do echo $(date -u) >> /example/out.txt; sleep 5; done"]
         securityContext:
           privileged: true
     ```

---

### 8. **Install Required Packages in the Pod**
---------------------------------------------------

   - Install dependencies like `awscli` and the `mount-s3` RPM:
     ```bash
     yum install unzip -y
     yum install wget -y
     yum install util-linux-ng -y
     curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
     unzip awscliv2.zip
     ./aws/install
     wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.rpm
     yum install -y ./mount-s3.rpm
     ```

---

### 9. **Mount S3 Bucket to the Pod**
-------------------------------------------

   - Mount the S3 bucket to the desired directory in your pod:
     ```bash
     mount-s3 aws-s3-mountpoint-eks-01 /s3-mountpoint
     ```

---

### 10. **Test the Setup**
-----------------------------

   - Verify that the application running on the pod can successfully interact with the mounted S3 bucket by checking the output files.

---

### 11. **Cleaning Up**

   - After testing, delete the resources to clean up:
     - Delete the EKS cluster.
     - Remove the S3 bucket.
     - Delete IAM roles, policies, and service accounts.


# High Available ELK SETUP:
----------------------------

| **Best Practice**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Elasticsearch StatefulSets**  | Deploy Elasticsearch using Kubernetes StatefulSets for stable network identities and persistent storage, ideal for stateful applications. |
| **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**| Automatically adjust the number of Elasticsearch pods based on resource utilization (CPU/memory) to handle varying workloads. |
| **Node Auto-Scaling**               | Configure GKE node pools with auto-scaling to accommodate increased workload as Elasticsearch pods scale up due to HPA.      |
| **Use Headless Services**           | Configure Elasticsearch to use headless services in Kubernetes for internal node discovery and clustering using DNS.          |
| **Resource Requests and Limits**    | Define appropriate resource requests and limits for Elasticsearch pods to ensure intelligent pod placement and resource isolation. |
| **Custom JVM Settings**             | Customize JVM settings for Elasticsearch pods to optimize memory usage and garbage collection for resource-intensive operations. |
| **Monitoring and Scaling Policies** | Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and create scaling policies based on metrics such as cluster load or resource utilization. |
| **Regular Backups and Data Snapshots** | Set up regular backups and use Elasticsearchâ€™s snapshot and restore features for point-in-time backups of indices and configurations. |
| **Security and Access Control**     | Implement authentication and authorization with built-in security features or X-Pack Security, and control access using network policies or firewalls. |
| **Regular Maintenance and Updates** | Keep Elasticsearch and dependencies updated to benefit from bug fixes, improvements, and security patches.                    |
| **Consider Managed Elasticsearch**  | If self-managing Elasticsearch is complex, consider managed services like Elastic Cloud on GKE or other third-party providers. |
