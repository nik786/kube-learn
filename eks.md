| **Resource Type**            | Focuses on **CPU** and **memory** allocation to each pod.                                       | Focuses on the **number of pods** based on resource utilization like CPU or memory.              |
| **Use Case**                 | Suitable for workloads with **unpredictable resource demands** or single-instance workloads.    | Suitable for **stateless applications** where scaling the number of pods helps handle load.      |
| **Impact**                   | Adjusts **CPU/memory requests** for pods based on usage. Reschedules pods to apply the changes. | Scales the **number of pods** in a deployment based on current load (e.g., CPU utilization).      |
| **Example Command**          | `kubectl apply -f vpa.yaml`                                                                    | `kubectl autoscale deployment nginx --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10`                           |
| **Supported Metrics**        | Resource requests (CPU and memory).                                                             | Custom metrics, CPU, memory (e.g., CPU utilization, request rate).                               |
| **Example**                  | A podâ€™s resource requests for CPU might be adjusted if usage increases beyond the configured limits. | A deployment can scale from 3 to 5 replicas if the CPU utilization exceeds 80%.                   |
| **When to Use**              | When the resource requirements of a pod change dynamically (e.g., workloads with fluctuating usage). | When you need to increase or decrease the number of pods to handle an increase in traffic.        |

## How do I update my worker nodes?
AWS publishes EKS-optimized Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that include the necessary worker node binaries (Docker and Kubelet). This AMI is updated regularly and includes the most up-to-date version of these components. You can update your EKS managed nodes to the latest versions of the EKS-optimized AMIs with a single command in the EKS console, API, or CLI.

If you are building your own custom AMIs for EKS worker nodes, AWS also publishes Packer scripts that document the build steps, allowing you to identify the binaries included in each version of the AMI.

---

## How much does Amazon EKS cost?
- You pay **$0.10 per hour** for each Amazon EKS cluster you create.
- You also pay for the AWS resources you create to run your Kubernetes worker nodes.
- You only pay for what you use, as you use itâ€”**no minimum fees and no upfront commitments**.

---

## Can I update my Kubernetes cluster to a new version?
Yes, Amazon EKS performs managed, in-place cluster upgrades for both Kubernetes and Amazon EKS platform versions. This simplifies cluster operations and lets you take advantage of the latest Kubernetes features, as well as updates to Amazon EKS configuration and security patches.

There are two types of updates you can apply to your Amazon EKS cluster:
1. **Kubernetes version updates**
2. **Amazon EKS platform version updates**

As new Kubernetes versions are released and validated for use with Amazon EKS, we will support **three stable Kubernetes versions** at any given time as part of the update process.

---

## What happens when pods die unexpectedly? Does EKS automatically restart them?
When pods die unexpectedly, EKS **does not automatically restart them**. Instead, it is up to the user to configure their own pod restart policies. This can be done using the kubeletâ€™s `--pod-infra-container-image` flag, which allows you to specify the image that will be used for the podâ€™s infrastructure container.

---

## What are the key components involved with Amazon EKS setup?
The key components involved in setting up Amazon EKS are:
- **Amazon EKS control plane**: Manages the Kubernetes cluster.

## Declarative CI/CD Pipeline for React App on EKS

1. **Checkout the Code from Repository**  
   - Clone the React app repository to the Jenkins pipeline workspace using the Git plugin.  
   - Example:  
     ```groovy
     stage('Checkout Code') {
         steps {
             git 'https://github.com/your-repo/react-app.git'
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Build the Code with Docker**  
   - Create a Dockerfile in the repository to build the React app container image.  
   - Use Jenkins to run the build process, generating the appâ€™s static build directory.  
   - Example:  
     ```groovy
     stage('Build with Docker') {
         steps {
             script {
                 docker.build('react-app:latest')
             }
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Analyze Build with SonarQube**  
   - Run SonarQube analysis on the build directory to ensure the code quality is high.  
   - If the score is 99 or above, proceed to the next steps; otherwise, halt the pipeline.  
   - Example:  
     ```groovy
     stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
         steps {
             script {
                 def sonarScanner = tool name: 'SonarScanner', type: 'ToolType'
                 sh "${sonarScanner}/bin/sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=react-app -Dsonar.sources=src"
             }
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Push to Nexus as Artifact**  
   - Store the build output in Nexus as an artifact if SonarQube analysis passes.  
   - Example:  
     ```groovy
     stage('Push to Nexus') {
         steps {
             script {
                 nexusArtifactUploader artifacts: [[artifactId: 'react-app', classifier: '', file: 'build', type: 'zip']],
                 nexusUrl: 'http://nexus-repository-url', credentialsId: 'nexus-credentials'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Build Docker Image and Scan with Trivy**  
   - Build the Docker image for the React app.  
   - Run a security scan using Trivy to check for vulnerabilities in the Docker image.  
   - If no vulnerabilities are found, proceed to the next steps; otherwise, halt the pipeline.  
   - Example:  
     ```groovy
     stage('Build and Scan Docker Image') {
         steps {
             script {
                 docker.build('react-app:latest')
                 sh 'trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL react-app:latest'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

6. **Push to Amazon ECR**  
   - Push the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) if the security scan is successful.  
   - Example:  
     ```groovy
     stage('Push to ECR') {
         steps {
             script {
                 withAWS(credentials: 'aws-credentials') {
                     docker.withRegistry('https://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com', 'aws-credentials') {
                         docker.image('react-app:latest').push('latest')
                     }
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

7. **Deploy to EKS using Ansible**  
   - Use Ansible to deploy the Docker container on EKS, ensuring the app is running in the cluster.  
   - Example:  
     ```groovy
     stage('Deploy to EKS') {
         steps {
             script {
                 ansiblePlaybook playbook: 'deploy-eks.yml', inventory: 'eks-inventory'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

8. **Post-Validation Test**  
   - Perform post-deployment validation tests to ensure the app is working correctly on EKS.  
   - Example:  
     ```groovy
     stage('Post-Validation') {
         steps {
             script {
                 sh 'curl -f http://my-app-url/health || exit 1'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

This pipeline automates the build, testing, security scanning, and deployment processes for a React app running on Amazon EKS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



This declarative CI/CD pipeline outlines the process for automating the build, test, security scan, and deployment of a React app to Amazon EKS using Jenkins. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code Checkout            | The code is retrieved from a Git repository.                                                   |
| Build with Docker        | The React app is built inside a Docker container.                                              |
| SonarQube Analysis       | The build is analyzed for code quality, ensuring a high score before proceeding.                |
| Push to Nexus            | The build output is stored as an artifact in Nexus.                                            |
| Docker Image Build and Trivy Scan | The Docker image is built and scanned for security vulnerabilities using Trivy.              |
| Push to ECR              | If the security scan passes, the Docker image is pushed to Amazon ECR.                         |
| Deploy to EKS            | Ansible is used to deploy the Docker image to an EKS cluster.                                  |
| Post-Validation Test     | A final health check ensures the app is correctly deployed and functioning on EKS.             |



This pipeline ensures an automated, secure, and efficient process for deploying React applications to a scalable Kubernetes environment like Amazon EKS.

| **Point**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. **Control Plane Management**      | The Amazon EKS control plane is managed by AWS, responsible for running the Kubernetes API server, etcd, and the scheduler. AWS handles the scaling, availability, and security of the control plane. |
| 2. **Kubernetes API Server**        | The control plane includes the Kubernetes API server, which acts as the central hub for communication between the Kubernetes master components and the worker nodes. It processes requests from users, clusters, and services. |
| 3. **Worker Node Communication**    | Worker nodes (EC2 instances) are configured to communicate with the control plane through the Kubernetes API server. They run the actual containerized applications and services in the cluster. |
| 4. **Cluster State Management**     | The control plane keeps track of the desired state of the cluster by maintaining the Kubernetes API. It receives updates from the worker nodes and ensures that the desired state is achieved and maintained (e.g., deployments, pods). |
| 5. **Etcd for State Storage**       | The control plane uses etcd, a key-value store, to persist the cluster's state data. It stores configuration data, service discovery information, and the overall state of the worker nodes, applications, and services running on the cluster. |
| 6. **API Server Authorization and Authentication** | The API server in the control plane handles authentication and authorization requests, verifying the identity of the user or service attempting to access the cluster. It works in conjunction with IAM roles, Kubernetes RBAC, and other security mechanisms. |



3. **How can you integrate Amazon EKS with AWS IAM for Service Accounts (IRSA) to manage pod-level AWS permissions? Provide a use case.**

| **Point** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1. **IRSA Overview** | AWS IAM for Service Accounts (IRSA) enables Kubernetes pods running on Amazon EKS to securely access AWS services using IAM roles. This eliminates the need for managing AWS credentials within the pod. |
| 2. **Service Account Creation** | Create a Kubernetes service account and associate it with an IAM role using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider. This role grants specific AWS permissions to pods that use this service account. |
| 3. **OIDC Identity Provider Setup** | Enable the OIDC identity provider in the EKS cluster to authenticate and authorize Kubernetes service accounts. The provider allows Kubernetes to map the service account to an IAM role. |
| 4. **IAM Role Association** | Attach IAM policies to the role that define the necessary AWS service permissions (e.g., S3 access, DynamoDB). The service account will inherit these permissions when pods use it. |
| 5. **Pod-Level Role Assignment** | When deploying pods, specify the Kubernetes service account in the pod specification. Pods using the service account inherit the IAM role's permissions, allowing them to interact with AWS services securely. |
| 6. **Use Case Example** | A pod running a data processing application requires access to an S3 bucket to read and write files. By associating the pod's service account with an IAM role that has the necessary S3 permissions, the pod can securely interact with the bucket without embedding AWS credentials. |

   

4. **What are the key considerations when using Amazon EKS with hybrid cloud architectures or multi-cloud environments? How does EKS support such configurations?**
   
| **Point** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1. **Networking and Connectivity** | In hybrid or multi-cloud architectures, establishing seamless networking between Amazon EKS clusters and other cloud environments (e.g., on-premises or other cloud providers) is critical. You must configure secure and reliable connectivity, such as VPNs, Direct Connect, or VPC peering, to ensure smooth communication between workloads. |
| 2. **Cluster Federation** | Amazon EKS supports cluster federation, which enables you to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters across different clouds or regions. Federation ensures that workloads can be distributed and orchestrated across clusters, providing high availability and fault tolerance in hybrid or multi-cloud setups. |
| 3. **Unified Management Tools** | Tools like Amazon EKS, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS Control Tower help manage Kubernetes clusters across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Additionally, tools like Kubernetes Federation and Helm can simplify multi-cluster deployment and configuration. |
| 4. **Security and Access Control** | Managing security across hybrid cloud environments is more complex. You need to configure cross-cloud IAM roles and identity federation. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) can be used to implement fine-grained access control policies to ensure secure communications between different environments. |
| 5. **Data Management and Storage** | Integrating storage solutions across clouds is a major consideration. Amazon EKS can leverage Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) or Amazon S3 for storage across hybrid setups. Multi-cloud environments may require third-party tools to integrate storage services from other providers (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage). |
| 6. **Application and Service Portability** | To maintain portability in a hybrid or multi-cloud architecture, containerized applications should be designed to be cloud-agnostic. Using a consistent CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure-as-code tools can help in managing application deployments across different cloud platforms, ensuring smooth rollouts and rollbacks. |


5. **How can you optimize networking performance in Amazon EKS using CNI plugins like AWS VPC CNI and Calico for advanced network policies?**

| **Point** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. AWS VPC CNI Plugin for Native VPC Networking** | The AWS VPC CNI plugin allows Kubernetes pods to receive IP addresses directly from the VPC, making them part of the VPC network. This ensures efficient and high-performance networking as pods can communicate with other resources in the VPC using native VPC networking capabilities, reducing overhead and improving performance. |
| **2. Enhanced Pod-to-Pod Networking**              | By enabling the AWS VPC CNI plugin, you ensure that Kubernetes pods use the same network security groups, routing tables, and VPC features as EC2 instances. This leads to better performance by leveraging AWS's low-latency, high-bandwidth networking infrastructure. |
| **3. Calico for Advanced Network Policies**        | Calico provides fine-grained control over pod-to-pod communication within your Amazon EKS cluster. It allows the definition of advanced network policies, such as ingress and egress rules, IP block policies, and traffic filtering, which can enhance security and optimize network usage within the cluster. |
| **4. Network Policy Enforcement with Calico**      | Calico enables the enforcement of Kubernetes network policies, which control traffic flow at the IP address or port level. This optimization improves performance by reducing unnecessary traffic and segmenting traffic to improve network utilization and security. |
| **5. IP Address Management with Calico**           | Calico's IP address management (IPAM) feature provides more efficient allocation of IP addresses, reducing IP address conflicts and ensuring optimal usage of the VPC IP space. This helps in managing large-scale clusters with high-performance requirements, ensuring that pod networking does not impact other workloads. |
| **6. Integration of VPC CNI and Calico for Performance and Security** | Combining the AWS VPC CNI plugin with Calico enhances both networking performance and security. While VPC CNI optimizes networking by directly assigning IPs from the VPC to pods, Calico's advanced network policies ensure that traffic flows are tightly controlled and secure. This hybrid approach can deliver a high-performing and secure networking environment in Amazon EKS. |



6. **How can you implement pod security policies (PSPs) in Amazon EKS to enforce security constraints on pod deployments? How does this relate to EKS-managed node groups?**
    
| **Point** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1. **Pod Security Policies (PSPs) Overview** | Pod Security Policies (PSPs) allow Kubernetes administrators to define a set of rules that restrict the types of actions that pods can perform, such as preventing privilege escalation, enforcing the use of specific security contexts, and restricting access to host namespaces. PSPs help ensure that pods are deployed securely and adhere to best practices. |
| 2. **Enabling PSPs in Amazon EKS** | Amazon EKS does not enable PSPs by default. You must first enable the PSP feature on your EKS cluster by creating the appropriate `PodSecurityPolicy` resources and configuring the `PodSecurityPolicy` controller or alternatives like OPA Gatekeeper to enforce the policies. |
| 3. **Defining Security Constraints for Pods** | Using PSPs, you can enforce constraints such as limiting the use of privileged containers, controlling the use of host networking and volumes, restricting container capabilities, and mandating the use of specific security contexts (e.g., non-root users). These policies help to reduce the attack surface within the Kubernetes environment. |
| 4. **PSPs in Relation to EKS-managed Node Groups** | When using EKS-managed node groups, the node security configurations (like the IAM role attached to the nodes) and the underlying worker nodes' security settings are not directly governed by PSPs. However, PSPs will apply to the pods running on these nodes to enforce security restrictions on pod deployments, regardless of the node configuration. |
| 5. **Pod Security and Node Group Compatibility** | EKS-managed node groups use Amazon Linux 2 or other container-optimized AMIs. While PSPs manage pod-level security, the underlying nodes must be configured with appropriate security settings (e.g., IAM roles, SELinux, AppArmor) to complement the policies set at the pod level. This ensures that security is enforced both at the node and pod level. |
| 6. **Using Alternatives to PSPs in EKS** | As of Kubernetes 1.21, PSPs are deprecated and scheduled for removal in Kubernetes 1.25. To continue enforcing security policies in EKS, consider using alternatives such as OPA Gatekeeper, Kyverno, or the Pod Security Standards (PSS) introduced in Kubernetes, which provides a more flexible way to enforce pod security within the EKS cluster. |

    

7. **What is the process for setting up and managing custom metrics in Amazon EKS using the Kubernetes Metrics Server, Prometheus, and CloudWatch Metrics?**

| **Point** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1. **Setting Up the Kubernetes Metrics Server** | The Kubernetes Metrics Server is an aggregator for resource usage data in the cluster (e.g., CPU and memory metrics). To set it up, install the Metrics Server using `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.4.4/components.yaml`. This provides resource utilization metrics for horizontal pod autoscaling. |
| 2. **Configuring Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) with Metrics Server** | Once the Metrics Server is installed, you can use it to configure Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA). This enables EKS to scale pods automatically based on metrics such as CPU and memory usage. For example, create an HPA with `kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment-name> --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10`. |
| 3. **Setting Up Prometheus for Custom Metrics** | Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that can collect custom metrics from Kubernetes pods. Install Prometheus using Helm (`helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack`). It can scrape metrics from pods and expose them for analysis and alerting. |
| 4. **Configuring Prometheus Metrics in EKS** | To collect custom metrics, you need to configure Prometheus to scrape your custom applications. This involves creating custom Prometheus configuration files that define scrape jobs for your appâ€™s endpoints. Use annotations like `prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'` on your Kubernetes deployments to indicate the endpoints to be scraped. |
| 5. **Integrating CloudWatch Metrics for EKS** | Amazon CloudWatch can be used to collect metrics from EKS for centralized monitoring. To send custom metrics to CloudWatch, use the CloudWatch Agent or AWS CloudWatch Container Insights, which provides insights into your EKS clusterâ€™s performance. Set up the CloudWatch Agent on your nodes and configure it to collect metrics such as disk usage, network traffic, and application logs. |
| 6. **Combining Metrics from Kubernetes, Prometheus, and CloudWatch** | Once Prometheus, the Kubernetes Metrics Server, and CloudWatch are set up, you can combine and analyze all the metrics to get a holistic view of the clusterâ€™s health. Use tools like Grafana to visualize Prometheus data, and CloudWatch Dashboards for a unified monitoring experience. Integrating these systems ensures better observability and helps with troubleshooting and autoscaling. |


8. **How can you configure Amazon EKS to handle large-scale workloads using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Cluster Autoscaler, and custom metrics?**
   
| **Point** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1. **Set Up the Metrics Server** | The Kubernetes Metrics Server is essential for Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA). Install the Metrics Server to collect resource metrics like CPU and memory usage for your EKS pods, which the HPA will use to scale pods based on demand. Install it with `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.4.4/components.yaml`. |
| 2. **Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** | HPA automatically scales the number of pod replicas in a deployment based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics. To enable HPA, create a deployment and then apply an HPA configuration, such as `kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment-name> --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10`, to adjust pod replicas based on CPU usage. |
| 3. **Install the Cluster Autoscaler** | The Cluster Autoscaler automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your EKS cluster to handle the demand. Install it on your EKS cluster by following the AWS EKS documentation. It ensures that when there are insufficient resources for pods, additional EC2 instances are provisioned, and unnecessary nodes are scaled down when demand decreases. |
| 4. **Configure Custom Metrics for Autoscaling** | To scale based on custom metrics, such as application-specific metrics (e.g., request count, latency), you can use Prometheus with custom metrics adapters. Install Prometheus to scrape custom application metrics and then configure HPA to use those metrics by integrating Prometheus with the Kubernetes custom metrics API. |
| 5. **Optimize HPA with Multiple Metrics** | You can enhance HPA by scaling based on multiple metrics. For example, you can create custom metrics for response time or queue length and use them alongside CPU metrics. Define the custom metric in your application and set up the HPA to scale based on a combination of metrics using the `metrics.k8s.io` API. |
| 6. **Tune HPA for Scale and Stability** | Fine-tune HPA's scaling behavior by adjusting the `minReplicas`, `maxReplicas`, and `target CPU/Memory utilization`. It's important to set realistic values for scaling thresholds to prevent unnecessary scaling, which could impact application performance or incur additional costs. |
| 7. **Use AWS Node Group Auto-Scaling** | EKS node groups are designed to scale dynamically based on demand. Use the Cluster Autoscaler in conjunction with AWS Auto Scaling Groups to automatically add or remove EC2 instances from your node group when the cluster requires additional capacity. This helps ensure that your cluster can scale efficiently with minimal human intervention. |
| 8. **Monitor and Adjust Cluster Performance** | Regularly monitor cluster performance using CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Kubernetes Dashboards to analyze the scaling decisions made by HPA and Cluster Autoscaler. Look for areas where scaling could be optimized further, and adjust your metrics or configurations based on the observed workload patterns to ensure efficient and cost-effective resource utilization. |


9. **What are the best practices for implementing disaster recovery (DR) strategies for EKS clusters, including cross-region and multi-cluster configurations?**
    
| **Point** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1. **Implement Cross-Region EKS Clusters** | Set up EKS clusters in multiple AWS regions to provide disaster recovery in case of regional failures. Replicate the workloads and services across regions to ensure high availability and failover capability. Use tools like AWS Global Accelerator or Route 53 for traffic routing across regions. |
| 2. **Automate Cluster Backup and Restore** | Regularly back up EKS clusters using tools like Velero, which provides disaster recovery by backing up cluster resources and persistent volumes. Automate the backup process, and test restore procedures periodically to ensure quick recovery during an actual disaster. |
| 3. **Use Multi-AZ Deployments for High Availability** | Configure EKS node groups and services across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. This ensures that even if one AZ goes down, the cluster remains functional in other AZs, providing resilience and minimizing downtime. |
| 4. **Implement Stateful Application Backup and Restore** | Use persistent storage solutions like Amazon EBS or Amazon EFS to store stateful application data. Ensure that backup strategies for these volumes are in place to restore the data in case of cluster failure, maintaining consistency across regions. |
| 5. **Cross-Cluster Traffic Management** | In a multi-cluster environment, use tools like AWS App Mesh or Istio for traffic management between clusters. This ensures that if one cluster fails, traffic can be redirected to the healthy cluster with minimal disruption. Use automated failover mechanisms for cross-cluster application recovery. |
| 6. **Leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | Use IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to automate the provisioning of EKS clusters and associated resources. This allows for fast recovery and cluster recreation in a different region or availability zone by simply applying the infrastructure code. |
| 7. **Monitor and Test Failover Mechanisms** | Implement regular testing of your DR strategy by simulating failures in different parts of your infrastructure. Use CloudWatch, Prometheus, and other monitoring tools to observe the health of the clusters and ensure that automated failover and recovery mechanisms are functioning as expected. |
| 8. **Define a Disaster Recovery Playbook** | Create a detailed disaster recovery playbook that outlines the steps for responding to various failure scenarios, including data recovery, cluster restoration, and application redeployment. Ensure that the team is well-trained in executing the DR plan to minimize downtime during actual incidents. |


10. **Explain how Amazon EKS integrates with AWS App Mesh to manage microservices, and what are the benefits of using App Mesh with EKS for service discovery and traffic management?**

| **Point** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1. **Seamless Integration with EKS** | AWS App Mesh integrates natively with Amazon EKS to provide service mesh capabilities for microservices running within Kubernetes clusters. App Mesh uses Envoy proxies deployed as sidecars within EKS pods to handle service-to-service communication, allowing centralized traffic management. |
| 2. **Simplified Service Discovery** | App Mesh provides automatic service discovery through its mesh architecture. By registering EKS services within the mesh, App Mesh allows microservices to discover each other using DNS, which simplifies communication between services without needing custom configuration for each service. |
| 3. **Traffic Routing and Management** | App Mesh offers advanced traffic routing capabilities such as canary deployments, blue-green deployments, and traffic splitting. This ensures that EKS applications can be deployed with minimal disruption and maximum flexibility, enabling granular control over traffic flows. |
| 4. **Improved Resilience and Fault Tolerance** | With App Mesh, EKS microservices benefit from built-in resilience features, including retries, circuit breaking, and timeouts. These features help to maintain high availability and fault tolerance, especially in distributed microservices architectures. |
| 5. **Enhanced Observability and Monitoring** | App Mesh provides deep visibility into service interactions through metrics, logs, and traces. By integrating with AWS CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, and other observability tools, App Mesh allows teams to monitor microservice communication and troubleshoot issues effectively within EKS clusters. |
| 6. **Centralized Security Management** | App Mesh supports fine-grained security policies, enabling encrypted communication (mTLS) between services. It integrates with IAM and other AWS security services to enforce access control, ensuring that only authorized services can communicate with each other within the EKS environment. |
