# Azure DevOps & SRE Real-Time Interview Questions with Answers

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | You’ve deployed an app to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and it fails health checks randomly. How do you debug this end-to-end? | Check `kubectl describe pod` for probe failures. Inspect readiness/liveness config. Review logs via `kubectl logs`, then check node CPU/memory pressure via `kubectl top`. Use `kubelet` logs and `Container Insights` in Azure Monitor for node-level diagnostics. |
| 2 | In a canary deployment to production, half the traffic returns 502, while others succeed. Walk us through your troubleshooting approach. | First confirm ingress/gateway health. Check canary pod logs and events. Verify service mesh routing config (Istio/nginx). Inspect TLS handshake if HTTPS is involved. Monitor load balancer and DNS caching. |
| 3 | CI/CD pipeline takes 40 mins to deploy a small change. What would you do to optimize it? | Identify slow stages with telemetry (e.g., pipeline analytics). Parallelize jobs. Use incremental builds and layer caching. Optimize test strategy (unit vs e2e). Offload artifact upload to background. Consider switching to pipeline-as-code for speed and caching. |
| 4 | You see high CPU usage in one pod, but logs look clean. What next? | Use `kubectl top pod` to confirm. Attach via `kubectl exec` and run `top` or `ps`. Enable verbose app logs. Check for GC issues (Java) or busy loops. Use Azure Monitor or Prometheus for CPU profiling. |
| 5 | You’re asked to design a highly available logging system for 100+ microservices across 3 regions. What tools and architecture would you suggest? | Use Fluent Bit/Fluentd sidecars -> Kafka or Event Hub -> centralized ELK/OpenSearch/Grafana Loki cluster (HA). Replicate storage across regions using Azure Blob or ADLS. Secure with RBAC and private endpoints. |
| 6 | Production app works fine for internal users but fails for external ones (403 error). How will you isolate the issue? | Use browser dev tools or curl to inspect headers. Check WAF rules and Application Gateway diagnostics. Compare IP ACLs or AuthN policies. Validate DNS resolution paths from external vs internal. |
| 7 | How do you ensure secure and dynamic secret rotation in Azure DevOps pipelines? | Integrate Azure Key Vault with DevOps service connections. Enable Key Vault references in variable groups. Use AAD-managed identity for secret access. Trigger rotations via Key Vault events and update pipelines via REST. |
| 8 | Explain how you’d use Azure Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall for a sensitive banking application. | Deploy AGW in WAF mode with OWASP rules (v3). Use private IP, TLS termination, and end-to-end encryption to backend pool. Enable diagnostics, custom rules, and path-based routing. Ensure subnet isolation. |
| 9 | During an Azure deployment, you receive intermittent DNS resolution issues. What can be the causes? | Possible causes: custom DNS server failure, Azure DNS throttling, VNET misconfiguration, CoreDNS crash in AKS, or transient Azure outage. Use `nslookup` and `kubectl logs` for DNS pods. |
| 10 | A user reports 10-second delays every 15 minutes in an app running on AKS. No code changes happened. How would you begin RCA? | Correlate with cluster metrics (via Log Analytics). Look for GC, autoscaling, HPA triggers, DNS timeouts, or noisy neighbor nodes. Enable sampling in Application Insights for trace correlation. |
| 11 | Jenkins jobs are randomly failing at the artifact upload step. What layers would you check? | Check disk I/O or bandwidth on Jenkins agents. Inspect object store (Azure Blob/Artifactory) access logs. Review concurrency limits or proxy timeouts. Retry logic and plugin versions may help too. |
| 12 | How would you set up an automated rollback strategy in Kubernetes for failed deployments? | Use `kubectl rollout undo`. Integrate readiness probe failures into pipeline logic. Leverage Argo Rollouts or Helm with canary strategy and auto rollback on 5xx errors or low SLOs. |
| 13 | Design a cost-optimized cloud architecture for an internal reporting app that runs every night and stores logs for 3 years. | Use Azure Functions/Container Jobs on timer trigger. Output logs to ADLS Gen2 with lifecycle rules. Archive logs in cold tier after 30 days. Schedule spot VMs or use ACI for job execution. |
| 14 | How do you handle zero-downtime database migrations in a distributed application? | Use feature toggles, blue/green DB schemas, and backward-compatible changes. Apply schema changes with tools like Liquibase or Flyway. Delay writes to new columns until all pods are updated. |
| 15 | What’s your approach to disaster recovery for stateful apps running on containers? | Use StatefulSets with PV replication across zones. Take regular volume snapshots. Replicate DB to DR region. Define DR Runbooks and automate cluster restore using Terraform/backup tooling. |
| 16 | An Azure function is being throttled. How will you detect and fix it? | Check metrics in Azure Monitor (throttle count). Scale up plan (Consumption to Premium). Optimize concurrency and memory. If storage triggers are slow, increase batch size or move to Event Hubs. |
| 17 | Define a plan for blue/green deployment with rollback on Azure using Terraform and pipelines. | Use separate slots or deployment environments (green = staging). Route traffic via Azure Front Door or App Gateway. Rollback by switching traffic back or using `terraform destroy` on new version. Automate checks in pipeline with approval gates. |
| 18 | How would you monitor end-to-end SLA for services in a payments pipeline? | Implement synthetic checks + real user monitoring. Add tracing with OpenTelemetry across services. Export metrics to Application Insights or Prometheus. Set alert rules on latency, error %, and SLOs. |
| 19 | Explain the difference in scaling strategies for compute-intensive vs I/O-intensive workloads in Azure. | For compute: scale on CPU/memory (AKS with HPA, VMSS). For I/O: use async processing, Event Hubs, scale disk throughput, or Azure Files Premium. Consider managed queues for burst buffering. |
| 20 | Suppose your production pipeline is blocked due to missing approvals and stakeholders are unreachable. What will you do? | Escalate via policy-defined channels (pager, Slack, Teams). Use pipeline conditions to auto-fail with message. Implement fallback change windows. For urgent fixes, invoke break-glass access with audit logs. |
