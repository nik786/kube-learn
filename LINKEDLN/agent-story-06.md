# 12 Principles for Building Reliable AI Agents

Designing AI agents is not just about intelligence — it’s about making them **reliable, scalable, and production-ready**.  

Here are 12 principles that matter most:

---

## 1. Natural Language Tool Calls
- Convert human prompts into structured commands.  
- Avoid brittle string-matching logic and ensure predictable behaviour.  

## 2. Own Your Prompts
- Treat prompts as version-controlled assets.  
- Document changes and manage prompt lifecycles for consistency.  

## 3. Own Your Context Window
- Curate exactly what enters the model’s context.  
- Prevent overflow, irrelevant data, and optimize token usage.  

## 4. Tools as Structured Outputs
- Standardize outputs using clear schemas.  
- Enable smooth chaining of tools while reducing errors.  

## 5. Unify Execution and Business State
- Maintain a single source of truth for state updates.  
- Make debugging and audits simpler.  

## 6. Launch, Pause, Resume via APIs
- Control agents programmatically.  
- Allow safe human intervention in critical workflows.  

## 7. Contact Humans via Tool Calls
- Request human approvals in structured ways.  
- Ensure compliance and safety in high-risk tasks.  

## 8. Own Your Control Flow
- Keep decision logic outside the LLM.  
- Use deterministic orchestration code to avoid unpredictable branching.  

## 9. Compact Errors into Context
- Summarize failures into concise entries.  
- Help agents learn from mistakes without bloating memory.  

## 10. Small, Focused Agents
- Build agents with single clear purposes.  
- Chain smaller agents to handle complex workflows.  

## 11. Trigger Anywhere
- Run agents from CLI, webhooks, schedulers, or apps.  
- Enable flexibility and integration across systems.  

## 12. Stateless Reducer Agents
- Design agents without persistent state.  
- Support horizontal scaling and fast restarts.

### 📌 Key Takeaway
Reliable AI agents come from **thoughtful design**:  
Clear roles, safe controls, and efficient memory management.
