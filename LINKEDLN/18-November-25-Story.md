- Kubernetes **Ingress is not being deprecated** — only the community-led **Ingress-NGINX controller** retires in March 2026.
- Ingress remains supported, and many other controllers like Traefik, HAProxy, AWS LBC, and F5 NGINX continue to work.
- You can safely keep using Ingress; nothing in Kubernetes itself is going away.
- Gateway API is the future, so learn it — but no urgent migration or panic is needed.
