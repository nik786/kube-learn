Netflix vs Adobe vs JioHotstar – DevOps Interview Flavors

Not all DevOps interviews test the same muscle.
Different companies = different chaos.
Here’s how it plays out:

Netflix – Streaming Scale
1. How do you keep p95 latency under 100ms during a global premiere with 30M+ concurrent viewers?
2. Debug a pod that looks healthy, but streams freeze only for mobile users in EMEA.
3. Rollout Envoy config → mTLS silently fails across regions. RCA in minutes.
Netflix tests your ability to triage live chaos under massive scale.

Adobe – SaaS Reliability
1. Your multi-tenant SaaS service is facing noisy neighbor issues. How do you enforce Kubernetes QoS and quotas?
2. A regional GCP outage. How do you failover customers with no data loss?
3. Explain how you’d design a zero-downtime CI/CD system for 500+ microservices that ship daily.
Adobe tests your architecture design, cost efficiency, and cross-cloud reliability.

JioHotstar – Media & Sports Events
1. India vs Pakistan match → 50M concurrent viewers. How do you scale API + caching without killing Redis?
2. Kafka partitions become skewed mid-match. Debug producer vs consumer imbalance.
3. DDoS attack during streaming. How do you keep latency < 50ms?
JioHotstar tests your ability to survive traffic spikes, caching chaos, and infra fire drills.

Takeaway:
Netflix → Can you debug silent failures at insane scale?
Adobe → Can you design resilient SaaS infra across clouds?
JioHotstar → Can you handle event-driven chaos when the world is watching?

InfraThrone trains you for all three. Not theory. Not YAML practice.
Real war room drills, RCA storytelling, and chaos simulations.
