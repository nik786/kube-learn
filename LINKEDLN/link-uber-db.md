Why Uber Moved from Postgres to MySQL
--------------------------------------

| **Reason**                         | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**                     | MySQL provided better support for scaling horizontally compared to Postgres, which helped Uber to manage their large-scale data needs more effectively.        |
| **Read/Write Performance**          | Uber's workload involved more reads than writes, and MySQL was optimized for such read-heavy workloads, offering better performance for their use case.         |
| **Replication**                     | MySQL's replication features (especially master-slave) were more mature and suited Uber's needs for distributing reads across multiple nodes.                  |
| **Tooling and Ecosystem**           | MySQL has a more mature tooling ecosystem and larger community support, which was beneficial for Uber’s infrastructure.                                        |
| **Cost and Resource Efficiency**    | With MySQL’s more efficient use of resources for certain workloads, Uber found it to be more cost-effective for large-scale data processing and operations.       |
| **Consistency with Other Systems**  | Uber’s other systems, like their caching layer (which used MySQL), were more consistent with MySQL, enabling better integration and easier management.           |
| **Operational Simplicity**          | MySQL’s operational simplicity, including ease of backup, maintenance, and troubleshooting, made it easier for Uber’s teams to manage.                        |
| **Compatibility with Sharding**     | MySQL's support for sharding (horizontal partitioning of databases) worked better with Uber’s data model, allowing them to partition data more effectively.       |
