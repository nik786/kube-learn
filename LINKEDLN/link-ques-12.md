| 1  | StatefulSet pods all connect to the same volume. Whatâ€™s wrong?                                              | Each pod should have its own PVC via volumeClaimTemplates. Ensure PVCs are templated correctly in the StatefulSet YAML.                                               |
| 2  | Schedule a job at 2 a.m. daily.                                                                             | Use a `CronJob` with `schedule: "0 2 * * *"`.                                                                                                                          |
| 3  | Allow a team to create but not delete pods in a namespace.                                                  | Create a Role with `create` verb on `pods`, but omit `delete`; bind via RoleBinding to the team's ServiceAccount or Group.                                            |
| 4  | Deployment maintains 5 replicas, only 3 are running.                                                        | Check events, `kubectl describe deployment`, pod status, node capacity, and possible quota limits.                                                                    |
| 5  | Restrict backend service access to pods with a specific label.                                              | Use a `NetworkPolicy` that allows ingress to backend pods only from pods with the specific label.                                                                     |
| 6  | CPU spike but autoscaling doesn't work.                                                                     | Check if resource limits/requests are set, if metrics server is running, and HPA is targeting the correct metrics.                                                     |
| 7  | Avoid running production workloads on spot/preemptible nodes.                                               | Use `nodeSelector`, `taints`, and `tolerations` to separate workloads onto stable nodes.                                                                              |
| 8  | Enable safe testing against production data.                                                                | Use data masking, read-only clones, or access via secured environments like ephemeral namespaces or isolated VPCs.                                                    |
| 9  | High CrashLoopBackOff events.                                                                               | Check pod logs, readiness/liveness probes, image startup errors, and backoff limits.                                                                                   |
| 10 | Deployment success but readiness probes fail.                                                               | Inspect the readiness probe settings, check application logs, and verify if the app is listening on the correct port and path.                                         |
| 11 | Expose internal app via HTTPS and custom domain.                                                            | Use Ingress with TLS configured via cert-manager and DNS pointing to LoadBalancer/Ingress IP.                                                                         |
| 12 | DNS resolution delay inside cluster.                                                                        | Check CoreDNS logs, latency from `busybox`, node DNS settings, and cluster DNS policies.                                                                               |
| 13 | Enforce all pods to define resource limits and requests.                                                   | Use a LimitRange and enforce policies using Gatekeeper/OPA or Kyverno.                                                                                                 |
| 14 | Prioritize critical pods over others under load.                                                            | Use `PriorityClass` to assign higher priority to critical pods.                                                                                                        |
| 15 | Drain node with zero downtime.                                                                              | Use `kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data`, ensure PDBs are respected to maintain service availability.                                            |
| 16 | Pod stuck in Terminating.                                                                                   | Check if finalizers are blocking deletion, or use `kubectl delete pod --grace-period=0 --force`.                                                                      |
| 17 | Access AWS S3 without hardcoded secrets.                                                                    | Use IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) with OIDC to allow pod access using IAM role.                                                                               |
| 18 | Logs from some pods missing in central logging.                                                             | Check if logging sidecar/agent is running, correct path is mounted, or container writes to stdout/stderr.                                                             |
| 19 | Config change caused downtime.                                                                              | Implement GitOps, use automated validation (CI), admission controllers, and require PR reviews for config changes.                                                     |
| 20 | Mount a file from Git repo at pod startup.                                                                  | Use an `initContainer` to `git clone`, or use CSI driver like `csi-git`.                                                                                               |
| 21 | Deploy app across multiple clusters with different configs.                                                 | Use Helm with values override or tools like ArgoCD + Kustomize for environment-specific configs.                                                                      |
| 22 | HPA not scaling down after CPU drops.                                                                       | Check cooldown period, minimum replica count, and metrics lag from Metrics Server.                                                                                    |
| 23 | Pod takes 2 minutes to start; marked unhealthy.                                                             | Adjust `initialDelaySeconds` in readiness/liveness probes to allow for startup time.                                                                                  |
| 24 | Container exits silently with no logs.                                                                      | Check container entrypoint, exit code, image command, and increase verbosity/debug logging; also review `events` from `kubectl describe`.                             |
