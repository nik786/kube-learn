You are observing an increase in 500 errors from a Kubernetes-hosted API. Describe how you would identify the root cause and remediate it.

2. A critical job runs daily at midnight but failed silently last night. How do you implement observability for jobs in Kubernetes to prevent this in future?

3. Your application’s pods are being OOMKilled frequently. How do you handle memory allocation and limits, and how do you monitor these at scale?

4. A deployment was mistakenly rolled out to production causing outages. How do you implement safe deployment strategies in Kubernetes to prevent this?

5. Latency between microservices has increased in your Kubernetes environment. What are your investigation steps, and what tools would you use?

6. How would you set up and test multi-region disaster recovery for a stateful Kubernetes workload?

7. You’ve been alerted that a node is flapping between Ready and NotReady. How would you go about resolving this and preventing recurrence?

8. During a cluster upgrade, a custom resource fails to reconcile. How do you identify which operator or controller is responsible and how do you fix it?

9. You notice a spike in Evicted pods in one node pool. What are the most common causes and how do you proactively monitor this condition?

10. A client complains of intermittent DNS resolution failures. How do you debug and tune CoreDNS within Kubernetes?

11. Your Prometheus instance has stopped scraping metrics intermittently. How do you ensure HA and scrape reliability?

12. You find inconsistencies in metrics between Prometheus and the application’s own metrics endpoint. How do you resolve this discrepancy?

13. A pod is in ImagePullBackOff. What advanced diagnostics can you apply beyond logs and describe?

14. You are tasked with auditing a Kubernetes cluster for best practices and SRE compliance. What key areas would you focus on?

15. During high traffic, pods are scaling up but traffic is still being dropped. How would you approach diagnosing and resolving this?

16. You are getting alerts for container CPU throttling. What steps do you take to analyze and fix this?

17. A network policy accidentally blocked service communication. What monitoring would you put in place to detect such issues faster?

18. A newly deployed Ingress route is failing to resolve for some users. How do you debug this and ensure DNS propagation is healthy?

19. Persistent volume claims are stuck in pending state. What are the advanced steps you take to investigate the provisioner behavior?

20. You are facing high API server latency. How would you measure and scale the control plane under load?
