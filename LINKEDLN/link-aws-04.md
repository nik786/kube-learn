|------|--------------|------------|
| 3Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ | What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in AWS? | Automating infrastructure provisioning using templates (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform). |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ | How does AWS CloudFormation compare to Terraform? | CloudFormation is AWS-native; Terraform is multi-cloud and more flexible with modules. |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ | What is AWS Fargate, and when should you use it? | Serverless container compute; ideal when you don‚Äôt want to manage EC2 infrastructure. |
