20. You’re leading a cloud migration, but halfway through, a critical security misconfiguration is found. How do you mitigate the risk and regain stakeholder trust?

    # Cloud Migration Risk Mitigation Plan

| Step                        | Action                                                                                       | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Immediate Containment    | Isolate affected resources, revoke exposed credentials, and disable misconfigured services.  | Prevent further exploitation and contain the impact.                   |
| 2. Root Cause Analysis      | Conduct a rapid assessment using logs, security tools, and team input.                      | Understand what went wrong and how it occurred.                        |
| 3. Patch & Remediate        | Apply configuration fixes, update IAM policies, enable monitoring and alerts.               | Eliminate the vulnerability and harden defenses.                       |
| 4. Communicate Transparently| Inform stakeholders with facts, scope, mitigation steps, and timelines.                     | Maintain trust through accountability and clear communication.         |
| 5. Security Audit           | Engage a third-party audit or run internal compliance checks.                              | Ensure no residual misconfigurations remain.                          |
| 6. Improve Governance       | Implement automated security checks (e.g., Terraform policies, CI/CD gates).               | Prevent similar issues in future migrations.                          |
| 7. Document & Educate       | Update runbooks and train teams on security best practices and lessons learned.             | Institutionalize learning and build a security-first culture.         |
