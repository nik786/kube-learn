1. Your application is experiencing intermittent connectivity issues with an external API. How do you troubleshoot and resolve this?

2. A new service deployed in Kubernetes cannot communicate with a backend database. What steps would you take to diagnose the issue?

3. You notice high latency when accessing a cloud-based application. What factors could be contributing, and how would you mitigate them?

4. Your team reports frequent SSH connection timeouts when accessing production servers. How would you debug this issue?

5. Your CI/CD pipeline fails due to network timeouts while pulling Docker images. What could be the cause, and how do you fix it?


Cloud Networking

6. A load balancer in AWS (ALB/ELB) is not distributing traffic evenly. What might be causing this?

7. Your Azure Virtual Machine cannot connect to an Azure SQL Database. What are the possible misconfigurations?

8. You need to establish secure communication between Kubernetes pods running in different cloud regions. What networking solution would you use?

9. Your AWS Lambda function times out when trying to reach a private database. What networking configurations should you check?

10. An application hosted on GCP is not accessible from the internet, even though it has a public IP. What could be the issue?


DNS & Load Balancing

11. Users report that your website sometimes resolves to the wrong IP address. How would you diagnose this DNS issue?

12. Your team deployed a DNS change, but some users still resolve to the old IP. How do you ensure a smooth transition?

13. A global application needs traffic routed based on user location. Which DNS or load balancing solutions would you use?

14. Your API Gateway is not forwarding requests to backend services correctly. What troubleshooting steps do you follow?

15. A DNS lookup takes too long, impacting API response times. What optimizations can you apply?


Security & Firewalls

16. Your Kubernetes cluster is being targeted by DDoS attacks. What security measures can you implement?

17. A DevOps team member cannot SSH into a production server, but the credentials are correct. What could be blocking access?

18. A new cloud-based service is unable to access an on-premises database. How would you diagnose firewall and VPN settings?

19. Your security team asks you to restrict access to a web application based on IP ranges. How do you implement this in AWS, Azure, or GCP?

20. You suspect that an attacker is trying to scan your cloud environment. How do you detect and prevent such activity?

Networking Performance & Monitoring

21. Your microservices application has high network latency between services. How do you identify the bottleneck?

22. A production system experiences random network outages, but there are no alerts in your monitoring tool. What steps do you take?
