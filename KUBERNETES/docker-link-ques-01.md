1. You need to deploy an application using Docker, but it requires different environment variables in different environments (dev, staging, prod). How would you handle this?

2. A developer pushes an image to a private Docker registry, but another developer is unable to pull it. What could be the issue, and how would you resolve it?

3. You need to ensure that a container restarts automatically if it crashes. What options in Docker can help achieve this?

4. Your application running in a container cannot connect to an external database. How would you troubleshoot and fix this?

5. A team member accidentally deleted a running container. How can you recover its data?


Intermediate Scenarios

6. A microservices-based application is running in multiple containers. How would you ensure communication between them?

7. Your containerized application logs are too verbose, and you need to collect and analyze them efficiently. What logging strategies can you implement?

8. You notice that your Docker image size is too large. How can you reduce it?

9. Your application requires a dependency that is not available in the official Docker image. How would you modify the image to include it?

10. You need to enforce resource limits on your Docker containers to prevent them from consuming too much CPU and memory. How would you do this?


Networking & Storage Scenarios

11. You need to expose a containerized service on a specific port and make it accessible to external users. How would you achieve this?

12. You have two services in separate Docker networks that need to communicate. How would you enable this communication?

13. A containerized database application needs persistent storage for its data. How would you configure this?

14. You need to share data between multiple containers. What Docker features can help you?

15. Your containerized application is experiencing network latency when communicating with other services. How would you debug and optimize this?

Security & Performance Scenarios

16. A security team asks you to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment. How would you do this?

17. You suspect a container is consuming too many resources. How would you monitor and identify the issue?

18. Your production containers need to run with minimal privileges. What best practices should you follow?

19. An attacker has gained access to a running container. How can you isolate and investigate the breach?

20. You need to prevent unauthorized access to Docker daemon API. How can you secure it?
