 1. Kubernetes Incident Management:
“Imagine you’re managing a production Kubernetes cluster and one of your critical services suddenly becomes unresponsive. What steps would you take to diagnose and resolve the issue?”
 2. Handling Traffic Spikes:
“How would you design a system in a cloud environment to handle sudden traffic spikes in a microservices architecture?”
 3. CI/CD Pipeline Troubleshooting:
“During a deployment, your CI/CD pipeline fails unexpectedly. What would be your approach to troubleshoot and fix the problem?”
 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
“Describe how you manage infrastructure changes using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation. What challenges have you encountered?”
 5. Disaster Recovery Strategy:
“What disaster recovery strategies would you implement in a cloud environment to ensure high availability for critical services?”
 6. Monitoring and Observability:
“How would you set up monitoring for a multi-region application? Which tools and metrics would you prioritize to ensure system health?”
 7. Security Breach Investigation:
“If you notice unusual traffic patterns that could indicate a security breach, what steps would you take to investigate and mitigate the threat?”
 8. Load Balancing in the Cloud:
“Explain how you would configure load balancing for an application deployed in the cloud. How do you ensure fault tolerance and high availability?”
 9. Centralized Logging:
“What approach would you use to aggregate logs from multiple services for centralized analysis, and how would this help in troubleshooting issues?”
 10. Service Discovery:
“In a dynamic microservices architecture, how do you manage service discovery to ensure smooth communication between services?”
