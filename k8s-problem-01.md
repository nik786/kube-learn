Question 1: In Linux, the Nice command is used to prioritize the execution of processes.
a. Tell me more about it and if given a choice where do you think it will be useful in your existing project ?

 the nice command provides a flexible mechanism for managing process priorities and optimizing 
 system resource utilization in Unix-like operating systems. 
 It helps ensure fair allocation of CPU time and improves overall system responsiveness.

| **Nice Command in Linux**                 | The `nice` command in Unix-like operating systems (including Linux) is used to adjust the priority of processes by setting a "niceness" value. Higher niceness values lower the priority of a process, while lower values (even negative) increase its priority.                                             |
| **Functionality**                         | The `nice` command modifies the process's priority, allowing system resources (like CPU) to be allocated more fairly among running processes. This is useful for managing background tasks, like batch jobs, without hindering the performance of interactive or foreground tasks.                            |
| **Usage Example**                         | Running a CPU-intensive task, such as compressing a file with gzip, with a lower priority: <br> `nice -n 10 gzip large_file.txt` <br> This ensures that the task consumes fewer CPU resources and other processes have more CPU time, maintaining system responsiveness.                                       |
| **Batch Job Management**                  | `nice` is useful in batch job management, where tasks are scheduled to run during periods of low system load. By reducing the priority of these jobs, they don't interfere with more critical, interactive workloads.                                                                                          |
| **Load Average**                          | Load average is the measure of the average number of processes waiting for CPU over a specified time period (1, 5, and 15 minutes). It helps in understanding system load and can signal if resources need to be upgraded or workloads need optimization.                                                    |
| **Key System Metric**                     | Load average is an indicator of how busy the system is. A high load average suggests that the system is overburdened and might need resource scaling or optimization of workloads to prevent bottlenecks.                                                                                                    |
| **Prioritizing Workloads in Docker & Kubernetes** | In Docker and Kubernetes, while there is no direct equivalent of the `nice` command, prioritizing workloads can be done using resource allocation and scheduling techniques.                                                                                                                             |
| **Resource Requests & Limits**            | In Kubernetes, resource requests and limits allow you to specify the minimum and maximum CPU and memory allocation for containers or pods. Higher resource requests give priority to those workloads when resources are limited.                                                                                   |
| **Quality of Service (QoS) Classes**      | Kubernetes assigns QoS classes to pods based on their resource requirements and usage. Pods with "guaranteed" QoS class (higher resource requirements) are given priority over "burstable" or "best-effort" QoS pods.                                                                                          |
| **Pod Priority & Preemption**             | Kubernetes allows assigning priority classes to pods, with higher priority pods preempting lower priority ones if resources are constrained. This ensures critical workloads are scheduled first.                                                                                                              |
| **Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)**         | PDBs ensure that a minimum number of pods are maintained during disruptions, like node maintenance or pod evictions. Configuring PDBs for critical workloads helps prevent their disruption during these events.                                                                                              |
| **Node Affinity & Anti-affinity**         | Kubernetes allows defining rules for pod placement based on node labels (node affinity) or ensuring pods are not placed together on the same node (anti-affinity). Critical workloads can be scheduled on nodes with better resources or higher performance characteristics using node affinity.                   |
| **Custom Schedulers & Admission Controllers** | Custom schedulers or admission controllers can be developed to implement scheduling logic based on workload priorities or specific criteria, enabling tailored resource allocation and workload prioritization in Kubernetes.                                                                                  |
