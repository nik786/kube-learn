## Istio Certificate and Identity Management Overview

### üîê Components Involved in Identity Creation


## Citadel: 
   - Part of the Istio control plane<br>- Authenticates and signs certificate requests<br>- Issues SPIFFE identity per service account
## Istio Agent:
   - Runs in each pod, assists Envoy<br>- Generates private key and CSR<br>- Acts as an SDS server<br>- Sends CSR and proof to Citadel |
## Envoy (SDS):
   - Uses Secret Discovery Service (SDS) to fetch certificates<br>- Does not load certs from disk<br>- Uses certs immediately when pushed |

### üîÑ Certificate Flow (SDS-based)

| **Step** | **Description**                                                                                  |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Workload starts and its Envoy sidecar contacts the **Istio Agent** with its service account info |
| 2        | **Istio Agent** validates the identity and generates a CSR                                        |
| 3        | Agent sends the CSR and service account JWT to **Citadel**                                       |
| 4        | **Citadel** authenticates and signs the certificate                                               |
| 5        | Signed certificate is cached in memory by **Istio Agent**                                         |
| 6        | **Envoy** receives certs from the Istio Agent via **SDS over Unix Domain Socket**                |

### üì¶ Key Characteristics

| **Feature**                      | **Details**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Key Storage**                  | In-memory only (never written to disk)                                       |
| **Renewal**                      | Istio Agent periodically refreshes certs before expiry                       |
| **SPIFFE Identity**             | Issued per service account                                                  |
| **Security**                     | No disk writes for certs or keys; uses JWT for proof                        |
| **Scalability**                  | Each component handles a distinct role in the flow                          |

### üß† Component Summary

| **Component**     | **Primary Job**                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Envoy**          | Uses certs, does not manage them                               |
| **Istio Agent**    | Generates key/CSR, handles SDS, communicates with Citadel     |
| **Citadel**        | Validates identity, signs certs, issues SPIFFE IDs            |

> ‚úÖ With SDS, there's **no need to redeploy proxies** or **restart workloads** to renew certificates.
