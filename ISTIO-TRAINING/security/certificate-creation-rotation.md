## Istio Certificate and Identity Management Overview

### üîê Components Involved in Identity Creation


## Citadel: 
   - Part of the Istio control plane
   - Authenticates and signs certificate requests
   - Issues SPIFFE identity per service account
## Istio Agent:
   - Runs in each pod, assists Envoy
   - Generates private key and CSR
   - Acts as an SDS server
   - Sends CSR and proof to Citadel
## Envoy (SDS):
   - Uses Secret Discovery Service (SDS) to fetch certificates
   - Does not load certs from disk
   - Uses certs immediately when pushed




## Certificate management in Ambient Mode
   - Node sidecars; ztunnel handles mTLS for multiple workloads
   - ztunnel requests certificates on behalf of workloads
   - Certificates are cached and rotated automatically

## Issuance Flow
   - Workloads communicate via ztunnel
   - ztunnel requests a certificate from Istiod
   - Istiod issues and signs certificate
   - ztunnel caches and uses the certificate for mTLS communication

## Rotation: 
 - ztunnel renews certificates automatically before expiration


## Certificate Creation and Rotation
  - Istio uses X.509 certificates for mutual TLS(mTLS)
  - Certificate management varies b/w sidecar mode and ambient mode
  - Istiod acts as the certificate authority, issuing and rotating certificates.

    

## Certificate management in Sidecar Mode
   - Each workload has an envoy proxy that handles mTLS.
   - The Istio Agent manages certificates and communicates with Istiod
   - Certificates are delivered via Secret Discovery Services(SDS).

## Issuance Flow
   - Envoy requests a certificate from the Istio Agent
   - Istio Agent sends a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to istiod
   - Istiod verifies the service account and signs the certificate
   - Istio Agent delivers the certificates to Envoy
   - Envoy uses it for mTLS communication

## Rotation: 
 - Certificates are renewed automatically before expiration.


## Certificate Issuance Flow in Sidecar Mode

- A workload starts, and its Envoy proxy contacts the Istio Agent to request a certificate.
- The Istio Agent generates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and sends it to istiod, along with the workload's Kubernetes Service Account JWT as identity proof.
- Istiod authenticates the request, verifies the service account, and signs the certificate.
- The Istio Agent caches the certificate and delivers it to the Envoy proxy via SDS.
- Envoy uses this certificate for mTLS communication with other workloads.


## Certificate Management in Ambient Mode


- A workload starts and communicates via ztunnel, which acts as its security boundary.
- ztunnel requests a certificate from istiod on behalf of the workload.
- Istiod verifies the workload‚Äôs SPIFFE identity and issues an X.509 certificate.
- ztunnel caches the certificate and uses it for mTLS communication.
- When a certificate nears expiration, ztunnel requests a new one from istiod, ensuring continuous rotation.

| Feature/Aspect              | Sidecar Mode                                 | Ambient Mode                                   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------    |
| **Architecture**           | Uses a per-pod sidecar proxy (Envoy)         | Uses node-level Layer 4 & Layer 7 proxies       |
| **Resource Usage**         | Higher resource usage due to per-pod proxy   | Lower resource usage by eliminating sidecars    |
| **mTLS Handling**          | Envoy sidecar per workload                   | ztunnel manages mTLS per node                   |
| **Performance Overhead**   | Higher due to multiple proxies per request   | Reduced latency with centralized processing     |
| **Certificate Rotation**   | Istio Agent via SDS                          | Ztunnel directly from istiod                    |
| **Certificate Issuance**   | Istiod issues workload certificates          | Istiod issues ztunnel certificates              |
