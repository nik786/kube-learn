Zipkin:

- Distributed tracing monitors microservices applications by tracking requests across services.
- Envoy assigns a unique request ID and traces requests as they travel through the mesh
- A distributed trace consists of multiple spans collected at different service components
- Tags provide metadata for filtering and querying spans, including
    - istio.mesh_id
    - istio.canonical_service
    - http.status_code


 ## Tracing in Sidecar vs Ambient Mode 

  - Sidecar Mode: Envoy proxies automatically generate spans for requests passing through them
  - Ambient Mode: L4 spans are generated by ztunnel, while L7 spans come from waypoint proxies
  - Applications should propagate tracing headers to maintain trace integrity


 ## Distributed Tracing with Zipkin

 - Zipkin is a distributed tracing system for monitoring requests in Istio
 - Tracing headers must be propagated across services to maintain trace integrity
 - Key tracing headers
