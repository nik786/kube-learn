# Multi-Cluster Deployment Models in Istio

| **#** | **Aspect**                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                              |

| 1     | **Multi-Cluster Benefits** | - Greater isolation and availability.<br>- Fault tolerance and scaling of network addresses.<br>- Workloads in different clusters use Istio gateways for communication. |
| 2     | **Control Plane Models**   | **Single Control Plane (Single Cluster):**<br>- One control plane for all workloads in a single cluster.<br><br>**Shared Control Plane (Multiple Clusters):**<br>- Control plane resides in the primary cluster.<br>- Remote clusters share the control plane.<br><br>**External Control Plane:**<br>- Control plane managed outside the clusters (e.g., by a cloud vendor).<br><br>**Multiple Control Planes (High Availability):**<br>- Control planes deployed in multiple clusters/zones/regions.<br>- Improved availability with failover support.<br>- Highest availability achieved by deploying a control plane in each cluster. |
| 3     | **Mesh Deployment Models** | **Single Mesh:**<br>- All services share a single mesh across clusters and networks.<br><br>**Multi-Mesh:**<br>- Services span multiple meshes with federated communication.<br>- Stronger isolation and reusable service names/namespaces.<br>- Requires trust establishment through trust bundles and policies. |
| 4     | **Tenancy Models**         | - Tenants are groups of users sharing workloads.<br>- Isolation achieved via network configurations and policies.<br>- Namespace tenancy: Namespaces with the same name are treated as the same across clusters.<br>- Cluster tenancy: Each cluster as an independent service mesh.<br>- Configurations are isolated per tenant. |
| 5     | **Best Practices**         | - Use separate control planes for each cluster for better availability.<br>- Adopt multi-mesh deployments for large-scale operations.<br>- Always use ingress gateways for inter-cluster communication.<br>- Avoid direct pod-to-pod connectivity to simplify operations and enhance performance.<br>- Use an external orchestrator to manage multiple meshes. |
