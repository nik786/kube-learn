| **1. Set Up Istio in Each Cluster**            | Install Istio in both Kubernetes clusters using Istio CLI or Helm. Ensure both clusters are using the same Istio version for compatibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **2. Enable Multi-Cluster Mode**               | Enable multi-cluster mode, either single-network or multi-network, depending on the setup. For cross-cluster communication, use the multi-network mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **3. Configure Istio Gateway**                 | Set up an Istio **IngressGateway** in both clusters to expose services for cross-cluster communication. Create a `Gateway` and `VirtualService` in each cluster to manage traffic.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **4. Enable Remote Access (Peer Authentication & ServiceEntry)** | Configure **PeerAuthentication** for mutual TLS between clusters for secure communication. Set up **ServiceEntry** in each cluster to allow services to access those in the remote cluster.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **5. Set Up Istio Control Plane Across Clusters** | Set up a **remote Istio control plane** across clusters, allowing the sharing of Istio components (e.g., `istiod`). Use `istioctl` to generate remote secrets and apply them to connect the clusters.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **6. Service Discovery and DNS Resolution**    | Ensure that DNS entries are correctly set up for cross-cluster service discovery. Use `ServiceEntry` for DNS resolution between clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **7. Test Communication Between Services**     | Deploy test services in both clusters and test communication between them using the Istio Gateway. Verify that traffic routes correctly across clusters.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **8. Monitor and Troubleshoot**                | Use Istio's observability features such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger to monitor traffic and troubleshoot any issues between clusters.                                                                                                                                                                           |
