To rotate secrets automatically in Kubernetes, you can utilize Kubernetes Secrets with the help of external 
tools or controllers that support secret rotation. Here's a general approach using Kubernetes native resources along with some external tools:

Use Kubernetes Secrets:

| **Approach**                                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Kubernetes Secrets**                        | Store sensitive information, such as passwords, API tokens, or TLS certificates, as Kubernetes Secrets.                                                                                                                                      |
| **External Secret Management Tools**              | Utilize external secret management tools or controllers that support automatic secret rotation. These tools integrate with Kubernetes and provide mechanisms for rotating secrets based on predefined policies or triggers.                    |
| **Implement Custom Controllers**                  | Develop custom controllers or operators to manage secret rotation within your Kubernetes cluster. These controllers can periodically check for expired or soon-to-expire secrets and rotate them accordingly.                              |
| **Leverage Kubernetes CronJobs**                  | Use Kubernetes CronJobs to schedule periodic jobs for secret rotation. These jobs can run scripts or commands to rotate secrets based on a predefined schedule.                                                                             |
| **Implement Sidecar Pattern**                     | Deploy a sidecar container alongside your application pods that are responsible for rotating secrets. The sidecar container can periodically check for expiration and rotate secrets as needed without interrupting the main application.       |
| **Use External Key Management Services**          | Integrate with external key management services or solutions that provide built-in support for secret rotation. These services offer APIs or mechanisms for rotating secrets automatically and can be integrated with Kubernetes.               |
| **Audit and Monitoring**                          | Implement auditing and monitoring mechanisms to track secret rotations and ensure they are performed successfully. This includes logging rotation events, monitoring the status of rotated secrets, and alerting on failures or issues.       |
| **Testing and Validation**                        | Thoroughly test and validate the secret rotation process to ensure it works as expected and does not impact the availability or security of your applications. This includes automated tests, manual validations, and security reviews.       |
| **Enable Dynamic Secrets Engine in Vault**        | Enable a dynamic secrets engine in HashiCorp Vault for secret rotation, such as for databases, AWS, or Azure. This engine will be responsible for managing and rotating secrets automatically.                                               |
| **Configure Rotation Policies in Vault**          | Define rotation policies for specific types of secrets (e.g., database credentials). These policies specify rotation periods, lease durations, and commands to execute before or after the rotation.                                       |
| **Enable Auto Rotation in Vault**                 | Configure Vault to automatically rotate secrets based on defined rotation policies. Vault can periodically check for secrets due for rotation and initiate the process.                                                                    |
| **Implement Pre- and Post-Rotation Hooks in Vault**| Implement hooks or scripts to perform additional tasks before or after rotating the secrets, such as updating configuration files or notifying services.                                                                                   |
| **Monitor Rotation Events in Vault**              | Set up monitoring and logging in Vault to track rotation events and ensure they occur according to the defined policies.                                                                                                                    |
| **Review and Update Rotation Policies in Vault**  | Regularly review and update Vault's rotation policies to ensure compliance with security best practices. Adjust parameters such as rotation periods and lease durations as needed.                                                          |
| **Enable Dynamic Secrets Engine in AWS Secrets Manager** | Enable a dynamic secrets engine (e.g., AWS, RDS, etc.) for secret rotation in AWS Secrets Manager.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Configure Rotation Lambda Function in AWS Secrets Manager** | Create a Lambda function for the rotation logic, including generating new versions of the secret and ensuring applications retrieve the latest version.                                                                                      |
| **Grant Permissions for Rotation in AWS Secrets Manager** | Ensure the Lambda function has permissions to read and write secrets in Secrets Manager. This involves setting appropriate IAM roles and policies.                                                                                          |
| **Test Rotation Logic in AWS Secrets Manager**    | Test the Lambda function and secret rotation logic to ensure proper functionality. Verify that it rotates the secrets without causing disruptions.                                                                                           |
| **Update Application Configuration for Rotation** | Modify applications to retrieve the latest version of secrets from AWS Secrets Manager dynamically.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Handle Versioning Issues in AWS Secrets Manager** | Implement application logic to handle versioning issues and retrieve the latest secret version. Use AWS SDKs or client libraries that support versioning.                                                                                   |
| **Monitor Rotation Events in AWS Secrets Manager** | Monitor rotation events and logs in AWS Secrets Manager using CloudWatch to ensure successful rotation and alert for errors.                                                                                                               |
| **Automate Testing and Validation in AWS Secrets Manager** | Set up automated testing and validation processes using tools like AWS CodePipeline or CodeBuild to ensure rotation logic remains functional.                                                                                             |
| **Use AWS Systems Manager for Automation**        | Leverage AWS Systems Manager (SSM) to automate secret rotation, using Run Command, Automation, and Lambda functions to perform tasks such as retrieving, generating, and updating secrets in Secrets Manager.                              |
| **Use SSM Parameter Store for Rotation**          | If secrets are stored in SSM Parameter Store, use similar automation capabilities as SSM Secrets Manager, with Lambda, Run Command, or Automation to rotate secrets.                                                                       |
| **Monitor and Log Rotation Events in SSM**        | Use CloudWatch Logs to monitor secret rotation events in AWS Systems Manager and set alarms or notifications for failures.                                                                                                                |
| **Integrate Lambda with SSM for Secret Rotation** | Integrate AWS Lambda with SSM to perform custom secret rotation logic triggered by scheduled events, such as CloudWatch Events.                                                                                                           |
