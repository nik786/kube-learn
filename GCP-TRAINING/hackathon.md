# Hackathon Ideas for AI, Blockchain & ML

| #  | Idea Name                     | Description | Tech Stack |
|----|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| 1  | **AI-Powered Fraud Detection** | Develop an **AI-based fraud detection system** that analyzes banking transactions in real-time to flag anomalies. Uses blockchain to store tamper-proof fraud reports. | Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch), Kafka, Blockchain (Hyperledger, Ethereum) |
| 2  | **Blockchain-Powered KYC System** | Build a **decentralized KYC verification system** where multiple banks can verify customer identities securely using blockchain. AI-driven identity verification for fraud detection. | Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, OpenAI API, OCR (Tesseract) |
| 3  | **AI-Driven Cloud Cost Optimizer** | Create a **ML-based cost optimization tool** for cloud infrastructure that predicts cost spikes and suggests actions. Blockchain can be used for transparent cost audits. | Python (Scikit-Learn), AWS Cost Explorer API, Terraform, Hyperledger |
| 4  | **Predictive DevSecOps AI** | Build an **AI-driven security risk predictor** that scans cloud deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and infra-as-code to detect vulnerabilities before they happen. Blockchain ensures tamper-proof audit logs. | OpenAI API, SonarQube, AWS Security Hub, Ethereum |
| 5  | **Decentralized AI Model Marketplace** | Design a **blockchain-based marketplace** where users can buy/sell AI models securely, ensuring transparency, provenance, and fair usage tracking. | Solidity, IPFS, TensorFlow, Chainlink, Polygon (Matic) |
