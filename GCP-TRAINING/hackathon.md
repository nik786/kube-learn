| #  | Idea Name                         | Description | Tech Stack |
|----|-----------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| 1  | **AI-Powered Financial Advisor**  | Build an AI chatbot that provides personalized financial advice based on user spending patterns, income, and goals. | OpenAI API, Python, Flask/Django, Barclays APIs, React/Angular |
| 2  | **Blockchain-Based Fraud Detection System** | Use blockchain to track transactions and detect fraudulent activities in real time. | Ethereum/Solana, Solidity, Python, Barclays APIs, Machine Learning (Anomaly Detection) |
| 3  | **Automated Loan Approval System** | AI-powered risk assessment system that analyzes creditworthiness using alternative data (e.g., utility bills, spending habits). | Python, ML models (Random Forest/XGBoost), Barclays APIs, AWS/GCP |
| 4  | **ESG Investment Tracker** | A tool that helps investors analyze ESG scores of companies before investing. | Barclays API, Python, Web Scraping (for ESG data), React.js |
| 5  | **Voice-Powered Banking Assistant** | A voice-enabled virtual assistant that helps users check balances, make payments, and set budgets using voice commands. | AWS Lex/Dialogflow, Python, Barclays APIs, React Native |
| 6  | **AI-Powered Fraud Detection** | Develop an AI-based fraud detection system that analyzes banking transactions in real-time to flag anomalies. Uses blockchain to store tamper-proof fraud reports. | Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch), Kafka, Blockchain (Hyperledger, Ethereum) |
| 7  | **Blockchain-Powered KYC System** | Build a decentralized KYC verification system where multiple banks can verify customer identities securely using blockchain. AI-driven identity verification for fraud detection. | Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, OpenAI API, OCR (Tesseract) |
| 8  | **AI-Driven Cloud Cost Optimizer** | Create an ML-based cost optimization tool for cloud infrastructure that predicts cost spikes and suggests actions. Blockchain can be used for transparent cost audits. | Python (Scikit-Learn), AWS Cost Explorer API, Terraform, Hyperledger |
| 9  | **Predictive DevSecOps AI** | Build an AI-driven security risk predictor that scans cloud deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and infra-as-code to detect vulnerabilities before they happen. Blockchain ensures tamper-proof audit logs. | OpenAI API, SonarQube, AWS Security Hub, Ethereum |
| 10 | **Decentralized AI Model Marketplace** | Design a blockchain-based marketplace where users can buy/sell AI models securely, ensuring transparency, provenance, and fair usage tracking. | Solidity, IPFS, TensorFlow, Chainlink, Polygon (Matic) |
