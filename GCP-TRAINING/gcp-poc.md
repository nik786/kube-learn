GCP Architecture Overview
Here’s how it all connects:

1️⃣ Frontend (UI)

React App hosted on Cloud Storage + Cloud CDN.
DNS managed by Cloud DNS.
SSL/TLS handled by Certificate Manager.
2️⃣ Backend (API)

Requests go through GCP API Gateway.
API Gateway routes traffic to Cloud Run (Fargate alternative).
Internal Load Balancer distributes traffic between backend services.
3️⃣ Database (Data Layer)

Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL Aurora alternative) stores data.
Secret Manager secures credentials.
4️⃣ Security & Monitoring

Cloud Armor (WAF) protects against attacks.
IAM policies secure access.
Operations Suite (Stackdriver) monitors logs and metrics.

Migration and Deployment Plan
Transfer S3 Bucket Content to GCS

Move all objects from AWS S3 to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using gsutil rsync or a migration tool.

Configure CDN

Set up Google Cloud CDN to cache and serve content efficiently.

Map CDN URL to Cloud DNS

Create a Cloud DNS record to point your domain/subdomain to the CDN URL for easy access.

Pull Image from ECR and Push to Google Container Registry (GCR)

Authenticate with AWS ECR, pull the container image, then push it to Google Container Registry (GCR) or Artifact Registry.

Deploy Application to Google Cloud Run

Use Google Cloud Run to deploy and run the containerized application from the image stored in GCR.

Launch Cloud SQL for Backend Database

Set up a Cloud SQL instance to host the backend database.

Configure database connectivity for the application.

Host All APIs on API Gateway

Deploy and configure Google Cloud API Gateway to manage and expose all backend APIs securely.
