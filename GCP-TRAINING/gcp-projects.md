Serverless Image Processing Pipeline
 Services: Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, Vision API.
 Idea: When an image is uploaded to Cloud Storage, trigger a function that:
 Runs OCR/object detection via Vision API
 Stores metadata in Firestore/BigQuery.


Serverless Email Notifier
 Services: Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Functions, Gmail API.
 Idea: A daily scheduled function that sends you reminders (e.g., weather, news, or Google Sheet tasks).

Multi-Region Microservice Deployment with Anthos
  Tech: Anthos, GKE, Config Sync, Cloud Run for Anthos.
  Idea: Deploy a simple microservice (e.g., product catalog API) to multiple clusters (GKE + on-prem simulation) using Anthos.
  Learning: Hybrid/multi-cloud deployment, Anthos Config Management, GitOps.


CI/CD Pipeline with Spinnaker + GKE

  Tech: GKE, Spinnaker, Artifact Registry.
  Idea: Build a containerized app (e.g., a Node.js API), push to Artifact Registry, then use Spinnaker to automatically deploy it to GKE with canary releases.
  Learning: Continuous Delivery, progressive rollouts.


Service Mesh for Secure Microservices
  Tech: GKE, Anthos Service Mesh (Istio).
  Idea: Deploy two microservices (orders + payments) on GKE and secure communication with mTLS using Anthos Service Mesh. Add traffic observability (Grafana/Kiali).
  Learning: Zero-trust networking, observability, service-to-service security.


Helm-Based Microservice Deployment
 Tech: GKE, Helm, Artifact Registry.
 Idea: Package a multi-service app (e.g., e-commerce with frontend, catalog, checkout) into Helm charts and deploy to GKE.
 Learning: Helm charts, templating, versioned app deployment.


GKE + Anthos Service Mesh for A/B Testing
  Tech: GKE, Anthos Service Mesh, Traffic Splitting.
  Idea: Run v1 and v2 of a recommendation service in GKE. Use ASM to direct 20% traffic to v2 for testing.
  Learning: Traffic management, canary testing, service resilience.


Least Privilege IAM Role Setup for Microservices
  Tech: IAM Roles, Service Accounts, Cloud Run / GKE.
  Idea: Deploy two microservices:
     orders-service → needs Firestore read/write
     reporting-service → needs BigQuery read-only
     Configure separate service accounts with custom IAM roles and attach to each service.
     Learning: Principle of least privilege, fine-grained IAM design.


Secure Service-to-Service Communication with Workload Identity
 Tech: GKE, Workload Identity, IAM, Pub/Sub.
 Idea: Run a GKE service that publishes to Pub/Sub → secure it with Workload Identity instead of using JSON keys.
 Learning: No key credentials, mapping GCP IAM → Kubernetes service accounts.



Hub-and-Spoke Networking with Cloud Router + Transit Gateway Equivalent (VPC Peering / Network Connectivity Center)

 Tech: VPC Networks, NCC (Network Connectivity Center), Cloud Router, Firewall Rules.
 Idea:
    Build a hub-and-spoke network across 3 projects (spokes).
    Central hub manages all egress/ingress.
    Enforce firewall rules and IAM for networking.
    Learning: Enterprise networking, centralized governance, transit-style networking on GCP.


Three Tier Setup app

Presentation Tier:
      Cloud Storage (Static Assets) → Images, static files served privately.
      Cloud CDN (like CloudFront in AWS) → Caches content globally.
      Google Cloud DNS → Custom domain resolution to the LB.

Application Tier:
    App Engine Services (microservices)
          auth-service (user login/signup via Google Identity API).
          order-service (handles order lifecycle).
          payment-service (simulated payment microservice).

    Google API Gateway → Fronts App Engine services with a single endpoint.
    Internal Load Balancer (Google ALB) → Routes traffic privately between services.
    Private VPC Link → Secure connection between App Engine services and Cloud SQL.
  

Data Tier:
  Cloud SQL (Postgres/MySQL)
  Deployed in a private VPC subnet (no public IP).
  Accessed only via private service connect from backend services.
  

Networking & Security
  VPC (Custom mode) → 3 subnets (frontend, app, db).
  Firewall Rules → Allow only necessary east-west traffic.
  Cloud NAT → Outbound internet access for private workloads.

IAM Policies →
  App Engine service accounts with least privilege.
  Cloud SQL IAM authentication.
  VPC Service Controls → Prevent data exfiltration.


Workflow

  User accesses app.example.com (Cloud DNS) → routed to Google External HTTP(S) Load Balancer with Cloud CDN.
  LB routes request to App Engine frontend service.
  Frontend calls App Engine backend microservices (via API Gateway).
  Backend services fetch/store data in Cloud SQL (via private VPC link).
  Static content and files are served from Cloud Storage (private bucket with signed URLs).
