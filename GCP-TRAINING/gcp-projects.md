## 📸 1. Serverless Image Processing Pipeline
**Services**: Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, Vision API  
**Idea**:  
- Triggered when an image is uploaded to Cloud Storage.  
- Runs OCR/object detection via Vision API.  
- Stores metadata in Firestore/BigQuery.

## 📧 2. Serverless Email Notifier
**Services**: Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Functions, Gmail API  
**Idea**:  
- A daily scheduled function sends reminders (weather, news, or Google Sheets tasks).  

---

## 🌍 3. Multi-Region Microservice Deployment with Anthos
**Tech**: Anthos, GKE, Config Sync, Cloud Run for Anthos  
**Idea**:  
- Deploy a **product catalog API** across multiple clusters (GKE + on-prem).  
**Learning**: Hybrid/multi-cloud deployment, Anthos Config Management, GitOps.  

---

## 🔄 4. CI/CD Pipeline with Spinnaker + GKE
**Tech**: GKE, Spinnaker, Artifact Registry  
**Idea**:  
- Containerized Node.js API → push to Artifact Registry.  
- Spinnaker auto-deploys to GKE with **canary releases**.  
**Learning**: Continuous Delivery, progressive rollouts.  

---

## 🔐 5. Service Mesh for Secure Microservices
**Tech**: GKE, Anthos Service Mesh (Istio)  
**Idea**:  
- Deploy **orders** + **payments** services on GKE.  
- Secure comms with **mTLS** using Anthos Service Mesh.  
- Add observability with **Grafana/Kiali**.  
**Learning**: Zero-trust networking, observability, service-to-service security.  

---

## 📦 6. Helm-Based Microservice Deployment
**Tech**: GKE, Helm, Artifact Registry  
**Idea**:  
- Package multi-service e-commerce app (`frontend`, `catalog`, `checkout`) into Helm charts.  
- Deploy and version them in GKE.  
**Learning**: Helm charts, templating, versioned app deployment.  

---

## 🧪 7. GKE + Anthos Service Mesh for A/B Testing
**Tech**: GKE, Anthos Service Mesh, Traffic Splitting  
**Idea**:  
- Run **v1 and v2** of a recommendation service in GKE.  
- Route **20% traffic → v2** for testing.  
**Learning**: Canary testing, traffic management, service resilience.  

---

## 🔒 8. Least Privilege IAM Role Setup for Microservices
**Tech**: IAM Roles, Service Accounts, Cloud Run / GKE  
**Idea**:  
- Deploy two microservices:  
  - `orders-service` → Firestore read/write  
  - `reporting-service` → BigQuery read-only  
- Configure **separate service accounts with custom IAM roles**.  
**Learning**: Principle of least privilege, fine-grained IAM design.  

---

## 🛡️ 9. Secure Service-to-Service Communication with Workload Identity
**Tech**: GKE, Workload Identity, IAM, Pub/Sub  
**Idea**:  
- GKE service publishes to Pub/Sub.  
- Authentication handled via **Workload Identity**, no JSON keys.  
**Learning**: Keyless authentication, IAM ↔ Kubernetes service account mapping.  

---

## 🌐 10. Hub-and-Spoke Networking with Cloud Router + NCC
**Tech**: VPC Networks, Network Connectivity Center (NCC), Cloud Router, Firewall Rules  
**Idea**:  
- Build a **hub-and-spoke network** across 3 projects.  
- Central hub manages all egress/ingress.  
- Enforce firewall + IAM at networking layer.  
**Learning**: Enterprise networking, transit-style GCP networking, governance.  

---

## 🏛️ 11. Three-Tier Microservice Setup (App Engine + Private VPC)

### **Presentation Tier**
- **Cloud Storage** (private static assets).  
- **Cloud CDN** (global caching, like AWS CloudFront).  
- **Google Cloud DNS** → Custom domain to LB.  

### **Application Tier**
- **App Engine microservices**:  
  - `auth-service` (login/signup with Google Identity API).  
  - `order-service` (order lifecycle).  
  - `payment-service` (simulated payments).  
- **Google API Gateway** → Unified entrypoint.  
- **Internal Load Balancer (ALB)** → Private routing between services.  
- **Private VPC Link** → Secure access to Cloud SQL.  

### **Data Tier**
- **Cloud SQL (Postgres/MySQL)** in **private VPC subnet** (no public IP).  
- Accessed via **Private Service Connect** only.  
- **Cloud Storage (private bucket)** for uploads with signed URLs.  

### **Networking & Security**
- **Custom VPC** with 3 subnets (frontend, app, db).  
- **Firewall rules** → allow only east-west traffic.  
- **Cloud NAT** → outbound internet access for workloads.  
- **IAM Policies**:  
  - App Engine service accounts with least privilege.  
  - Cloud SQL IAM authentication.  
- **VPC Service Controls** → prevent data exfiltration.  

### **Workflow**
1. User visits `app.example.com` (Cloud DNS).  
2. Request → **External HTTP(S) Load Balancer** with Cloud CDN.  
3. LB → **App Engine frontend**.  
4. Frontend → **App Engine backend microservices (via API Gateway)**.  
5. Backend → **Cloud SQL** via private VPC link.  
6. Static files → **Cloud Storage (signed URLs)**.
