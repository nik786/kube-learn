## 📸 1. Serverless Image Processing Pipeline
**Services**: Cloud Storage, Cloud Run Function, Pub/Sub  

**Idea**:  
- Cloud Run Function triggered when an image is uploaded to Cloud Storage.  
- Pub/Sub publishes event and metadata is stored in the Cloud Storage bucket.

## 📧 2. Serverless Email Notifier
**Services**: Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Functions, Gmail API  

**Idea**:  
- A daily scheduled function sends reminders (weather, news, or Google Sheets tasks).  

---

## 🌍 3. Terraform: Multi-AZ GKE Cluster in Private VPC
**Tech**: GKE  

**Idea**:  
- Deploy cost-effective multi-AZ cluster in private VPC.  
- Integrate load balancer, ingress controller, node pool, and security groups.  

**Learning**: Private networking + scalable GKE setup.  

---

## 📦 4. HashiCorp Vault Deployment on GKE
**Tech**: GKE, Helm  

**Idea**:  
- Package HashiCorp Vault into a Helm chart.  
- Deploy once, manage secrets securely.  

**Learning**: Secrets management in Kubernetes.  

---

## ⬆️ 5. Terraform: Zero Downtime GKE Upgrade
**Tech**: GKE  

**Idea**:  
- Automate GKE upgrades with Terraform.  
- Ensure zero downtime during rolling updates.  

**Learning**: Infrastructure automation & high availability.  

---

## 🔄 6. Mini CI/CD with ArgoCD + GKE
**Tech**: GKE, Artifact Registry, ArgoCD  

**Idea**:  
- Build & push a Node.js API to Artifact Registry.  
- Auto-deploy via ArgoCD with canary strategy (e.g., 80/20 traffic split).  

**Learning**: GitOps CD + progressive rollout.  

---

## 🔐 7. Lightweight Service Mesh Security
**Tech**: GKE, Istio (minimal profile)  

**Idea**:  
- Deploy **orders** and **payments** microservices.  
- Enable **mTLS** for internal communication.  
- Use Istio dashboard/Grafana for observability.  

**Learning**: Service-to-service security + observability.  

---

## 🧪 8. A/B Testing with Istio Traffic Split
**Tech**: GKE, Istio  

**Idea**:  
- Deploy `recommendation` service with `v1` and `v2`.  
- Configure Istio VirtualService to send **20% traffic → v2, 80% → v1**.  

**Learning**: Canary testing, traffic routing, resilience.  

---

## 🔒 9. Least Privilege IAM Role Setup for Microservices
**Tech**: IAM Roles, Service Accounts, Cloud Run / GKE  

**Idea**:  
- Deploy two microservices:  
  - `orders-service` → Firestore read/write  
  - `reporting-service` → BigQuery read-only  
- Assign custom IAM roles per service.  

**Learning**: Principle of least privilege, IAM design.  

---

## 🛡️ 10. Secure Service-to-Service Communication with Workload Identity
**Tech**: GKE, IAM, Pub/Sub  

**Idea**:  
- GKE service publishes messages to Pub/Sub.  
- Authentication via **Workload Identity** (no JSON keys).  

**Learning**: Keyless authentication & IAM-Kubernetes integration.  

---

## 🌐 11. Hub-and-Spoke Networking with Cloud Router + NCC
**Tech**: VPC Networks, NCC, Cloud Router, Firewall Rules  

**Idea**:  
- Build **hub-and-spoke network** across 3 projects.  
- Central hub manages all egress/ingress traffic.  
- Enforce firewall + IAM at networking layer.  

**Learning**: Enterprise networking & governance.  

---

## 🏛️ 12. Three-Tier Microservice Setup (App Engine + Private VPC)

### **Presentation Tier**
- Cloud Storage (private static assets)  
- Cloud CDN (global caching)  
- Google Cloud DNS → Custom domain → Load Balancer  

### **Application Tier**
- App Engine microservices:  
  - `auth-service` (login/signup with Google Identity API)  
  - `order-service` (order lifecycle)  
  - `payment-service` (simulated payments)  
- API Gateway → Unified entrypoint  
- Internal Load Balancer → Private routing  
- Private VPC Link → Secure Cloud SQL access  

### **Data Tier**
- Cloud SQL (Postgres/MySQL) in **private subnet**  
- Private Service Connect → No public IP  
- Cloud Storage (private bucket) with signed URLs  

### **Networking & Security**
- Custom VPC with 3 subnets (frontend, app, db)  
- Firewall rules → east-west traffic only  
- Cloud NAT → outbound internet access  
- IAM policies → least privilege per service  
- VPC Service Controls → prevent data exfiltration  

**Workflow**:  
1. User visits `app.example.com` (Cloud DNS).  
2. Request → External HTTP(S) Load Balancer + Cloud CDN.  
3. LB → App Engine frontend.  
4. Frontend → Backend microservices (via API Gateway).  
5. Backend → Cloud SQL (private VPC link).  
6. Static files → Cloud Storage (signed URLs).

## 🤖 13. GenAI-Powered Daily Insights Bot
**Services**: Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Functions (Python), Vertex AI, Pub/Sub, BigQuery  

**Idea**:  
- Cloud Scheduler triggers a Cloud Function daily.  
- Function calls Vertex AI (Gemini API) to generate insights:  
  - Project status summary  
  - Tech news brief  
  - AI-written daily to-do plan  
- Insights published to Pub/Sub:  
  - One subscriber stores them in BigQuery for historical analysis.  
  - Another pushes notifications to Cloud Logging / Monitoring.  

**Learning**:  
- Serverless automation with GenAI.  
- Using Vertex AI API from Cloud Functions.  
- Event-driven architecture with Pub/Sub.  
- Analyzing AI content in BigQuery.
