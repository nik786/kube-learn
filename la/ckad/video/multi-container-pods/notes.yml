[multi-container-pods]
These are simply pods with more than one container that all work together as a single unit

It is good idea to keep conatiners separate by keep them in their own sepaarate pods
but there are several cases where multi container pods can be beneficial

we can create multi container pods by listing multiple containers in the pod  definition

[Interaction of containers in a pod]

[shared network]
All listing ports are accessible to other containers in the pod even if they are nt exposed outside the pod

[shared storage volumes]

containers can interact with each other by reading and modifying files in a shared storage volume which is mounted with in both containers


[shared process namespaces]

containers in the same pod can interact with and signal one anothers process.

Enable process namespaces sharing by setting 
shareProcessNamespace: true

in the pod spec
