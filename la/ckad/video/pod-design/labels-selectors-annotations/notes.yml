[Labels]
It is key-value pairs attached to kubernetes objects.
It is used for identifying various attributes of objects which can in turn  be used to select and group 
various subsets of those objects.

We can attach labels to objects by listing them in metadata.labels section of an object descriptor

[Selectors]

It is used for identifying and selecting a specific group of objects using their labels.
We can specify selector using -l flag.

kubectl get pods -l app=my-app

kubectl get pods -l environment in (production.development)

kubectl get pods -l app=my-app,environment=production

kubectl get pods -l environment!=production

[annotations]
It can be used to store custom metadata about objects.

We can attach annotations to objects using the metadata.annotations section of the object descriptor
