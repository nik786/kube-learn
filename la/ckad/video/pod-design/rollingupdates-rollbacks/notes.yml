[rollingupdates]
provide a way to update a deployment to a new container version by gradullay updating replicas so 
that there is no downtime

execute rolling update with kubectl set image

kubectl set image deployment/rolling-deployment nginx=nginx:1.7.9 --record


[-- record flag]

It records information about the update which can be rolled back later

[rollbacks]
it allows us to revert to a previous state.
if a rolling update breaks something we can quickly recover by using a rollback


kubectl rollout history deployment/rolling-deployment

[--revision flag]

kubectl rollout history deployment/rolling-deployment --revision=2


[undo the last revision]

kubectl rollout undo deployment/rolling-deployment 

kubectl rollout undo deployment/rolling-deployment  --to-revision=1


it is possible to rollback to specific version

kubectl rollout undo deployment/deployment
