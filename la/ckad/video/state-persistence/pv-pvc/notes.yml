[state persistence]
[stateless]
It is designed to manage stateless containers.
Pods and containers can be easily deleted or replaced.
When a container is removed , data stored inside containers internal disk is lost

[state]
It refers to maintaining data outside and potentially beyond the life of a container
This usually means storing data in some kind of persistent data store that can be accessed by containers

Kubernetes allows us to implent persistent storage using PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims


[Persistence Volume]
Represents a storage resource

[PersistenceVolumeClaim]
Abstraction layer b/w user and the pv
PVC will automatically bind themselves to a PV  that has compatible StorageClass and accessModes.

[storageClassName]
Defines different catagories of storage

[capacity]
storage amount for the PV

[accessModes]
Determines what read/write modes can be used to mount volume

[hostPath]
use nodes local filesystem for storage
