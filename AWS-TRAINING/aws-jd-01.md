Cloud Readiness Assessment
A Cloud Readiness Assessment is an evaluation of an organization's IT systems, people, and processes to see how prepared they are to move to the cloud.

This includes reviewing things like:

Existing infrastructure and applications

Security and compliance requirements

Team skill levels

Cost models

Gaps that must be addressed before migration

✅ Design & Implementations
This refers to designing cloud architectures and actually building them using AWS services. Examples:

Setting up VPCs, subnets, IAM, S3, EC2, etc.

Creating automation pipelines, tagging strategies

Designing for scalability, security, and availability

✅ AWS CAF (Cloud Adoption Framework)
AWS CAF is a framework provided by AWS that guides organizations in migrating to the cloud. It has 6 key perspectives:

Business

People

Governance

Platform

Security

Operations

The idea is to ensure a structured, strategic approach to migration, not just a lift-and-shift.

✅ Landing Zone
An AWS Landing Zone is a pre-configured, secure, scalable AWS environment that’s ready to deploy workloads in.

It includes:

Multi-account setup

Centralized logging

Identity and access management

Security baselines

Networking and governance guardrails
