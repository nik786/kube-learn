# Three-Tier Architecture

Three-tier architecture is called **three-tier** because the system is split into **three distinct layers (tiers)**, each with its own responsibility, working together to deliver the full application.

Think of it like a well-organized restaurant:
- **Menu & waiters** take your orders (**presentation tier**)
- **Kitchen** prepares food based on orders (**application tier**)
- **Pantry & fridge** store all the raw materials (**data tier**)

---

## The Three Tiers

### 1. Presentation Tier (UI Layer)
- What the user sees and interacts with (web pages, mobile app screens, etc.)
- **Examples:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, mobile app UI

### 2. Application Tier (Logic Layer)
- Processes the userâ€™s requests, applies business logic, talks to the database, and returns results
- **Examples:** Java, Python, .NET backend, API services

### 3. Data Tier (Database Layer)
- Stores and retrieves data, keeping it safe and organized
- **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

---

## Why It's Called "Three-Tier"
- Each **tier** is **physically and logically separated**
- Communication flows between these layers in a specific order
- You can update one tier without touching the others (e.g., change database type without changing UI)

# Securing, Scaling, and Ensuring High Availability in a Three-Tier Architecture

A **Three-Tier Architecture** consists of:
1. **Presentation Layer (Client/UI)**
2. **Application Layer (Logic)**
3. **Data Layer (Database)**

Each layer requires strategies for **Security**, **High Availability (HA)**, and **Scalability**.

---

## 1. Presentation Layer (Client/UI)

### Security
- Use **HTTPS/TLS** for all client-server communication.
- Implement **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**.
- Enable **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
- Perform **input validation** to prevent injection attacks.

### High Availability
- Deploy **load balancers** (e.g., AWS ALB, Nginx) across multiple regions/zones.
- Use **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** for static assets to reduce latency and server load.
- Implement **health checks** for failover.

### Scalability
- Use **auto-scaling groups** for web servers.
- Serve static content from **object storage** (e.g., Amazon S3).
- Implement **horizontal scaling** by adding more web instances.

---

## 2. Application Layer (Logic)

### Security
- Implement **API Gateway** with authentication and rate limiting.
- Use **IAM roles** with least privilege.
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities.

### High Availability
- Deploy applications in **multiple availability zones**.
- Use **service mesh** for better service-to-service reliability.
- Implement **rolling deployments** and **blue-green deployments**.

### Scalability
- Use **container orchestration** (Kubernetes, ECS) for horizontal scaling.
- Apply **caching** (Redis, Memcached) for frequent requests.
- Design **stateless application servers** to allow easy scaling.

---

## 3. Data Layer (Database)

### Security
- Use **VPC** with private subnets for databases.
- Enable **encryption at rest** (e.g., AWS KMS).
- Use **SSL/TLS** for database connections.
- Implement **role-based access control**.
- Perform regular **backups** and patching.

### High Availability
- Configure **database replication** (read replicas, multi-AZ setups).
- Use **automatic failover**.
- Implement **backup and disaster recovery (DR)** strategy.

### Scalability
- Use **read replicas** for read-heavy workloads.
- Implement **database sharding** or partitioning.
- Use **caching layers** to reduce direct database load.
