# Debugging and Resolving Latency in Flask-Based API on EKS

| # | Debugging Step | Recommended Solution |
|---|----------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Check Pod Resource Limits & Requests** | Use appropriate `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` in Pod spec. |
| 2 | **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)** | Ensure HPA is enabled and triggers on CPU, memory, or custom metrics. |
| 3 | **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** | Enable VPA to recommend/request memory & CPU adjustments for pods. |
| 4 | **Enable Karpenter for Node Auto-scaling** | Use Karpenter to dynamically provision nodes based on Pod demands. |
| 5 | **Enable AWS X-Ray** | Use X-Ray SDK in Flask to trace end-to-end request latency and find bottlenecks. |
| 6 | **Monitor with AWS CloudWatch Insights** | Analyze structured logs and metrics using CloudWatch Logs Insights queries. |
| 7 | **Use OpenTelemetry + Kiali (with Istio)** | Trace services and visualize bottlenecks across microservices with Kiali dashboard. |
| 8 | **Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on DB Queries** | Identify slow SQL queries and add indexes or optimize logic. |
| 9 | **Use Larger EC2 Instance Types if Needed** | Upgrade to compute-optimized or memory-optimized instances under load. |
|10 | **Implement Caching (e.g., Redis)** | Cache frequently requested data to reduce DB hits and response time. |
|11 | **Use Amazon RDS Proxy** | Pool and manage database connections efficiently to reduce latency spikes. |
|12 | **API Fine Tuning (e.g., NGINX/Gunicorn)** | Use optimal workers, threads, and timeouts in Gunicorn or ASGI servers. |
|13 | **Replace Slow Libraries with Faster Alternatives** | Profile with `cProfile` or `py-spy` and swap slow Python libs. |
|14 | **Use Smaller, Optimized Docker Images** | Use minimal base images like `python:slim` or `alpine` to reduce cold start. |
|15 | **Use Cilium for Efficient Networking** | Replace default networking with Cilium for lower latency and observability. |
