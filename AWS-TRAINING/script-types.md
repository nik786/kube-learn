|                                                                        | 3. **EC2 Instance Management** - Starting, stopping, and monitoring EC2 instances.                          |
|                                                                        | 4. **SNS & SQS Messaging** - Sending notifications and managing message queues.                              |
|                                                                        | 5. **CloudWatch Log Processing** - Analyzing and filtering CloudWatch logs.                                 |
|                                                                        | In total, I have implemented **10+ Lambda functions** utilizing Boto3 for automating AWS operations.        |
| **What benefits has the project received due to this?**                | 1. **Reduced Operational Overhead** - Automating manual tasks, reducing human intervention.                 |
|                                                                        | 2. **Cost Optimization** - Efficient resource management leading to cost savings.                           |
|                                                                        | 3. **Improved Scalability** - Serverless functions scale dynamically with demand.                           |
|                                                                        | 4. **Faster Execution & Response Time** - Automating infrastructure tasks in real-time.                     |
|                                                                        | 5. **Enhanced Security** - Automated IAM role enforcement, access logging, and compliance monitoring.       |
| **Have you ever developed any serverless app?**                        | Yes, I have developed multiple serverless applications leveraging AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3.|
| **Give three examples of serverless applications you developed.**      | 1. **E-commerce Order Processing**: API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB for handling orders in a retail platform. |
|                                                                        | 2. **Automated Cloud Resource Cleanup**: Lambda functions triggered via CloudWatch to clean up unused resources. |
|                                                                        | 3. **Real-time Log Analytics**: Lambda processing CloudWatch logs and pushing insights to an S3 bucket for analysis. |
