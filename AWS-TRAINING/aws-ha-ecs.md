Scenario: Your organization is planning to deploy a containerized application on AWS 
using Amazon ECS. How would you design 
the architecture and infrastructure to orchestrate and manage containers effectively, 
ensuring scalability, availability, and performance?

| **Step**                               | **Solution/Implementation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Containerization Strategy**          | - Containerize application components using Docker.<br>- Break down the application into smaller, loosely coupled services for independent deployment and management.                                                                               |
| **Amazon ECS Cluster**                 | - Create an Amazon ECS cluster to host containerized applications.<br>- Choose ECS cluster mode (EC2 or Fargate) based on infrastructure management requirements.                                                                                   |
| **High Availability and Fault Tolerance** | - Deploy ECS tasks or services across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability and fault tolerance.<br>- Use ECS service autoscaling to scale tasks/services based on demand and resource utilization.                                |
| **Load Balancing and Traffic Routing** | - Use AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) to distribute traffic across ECS tasks/services.<br>- Implement target groups and listener rules to route traffic based on URL path or host headers.                         |
| **Service Discovery and DNS Routing**  | - Use AWS Cloud Map or Route 53 for service discovery and DNS-based routing.<br>- Register ECS services with Cloud Map or Route 53 to dynamically update DNS records and route traffic to appropriate services.                                  |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**       | - Use AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK to define and provision ECS infrastructure as code.<br>- Define ECS task definitions, services, load balancers, and resources in code for automated provisioning and version control.                       |
| **Container Registry**                 | - Use Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store and manage container images.<br>- Push Docker images to ECR and reference them in ECS task definitions for deployment.                                                                   |
| **Logging and Monitoring**             | - Configure centralized logging with Amazon CloudWatch Logs to capture and analyze ECS container logs.<br>- Use CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms to monitor ECS resource utilization, container health, and application performance.                  |
| **Security and Compliance**            | - Implement security best practices such as IAM roles, policies, network security groups, and encryption for ECS resources.<br>- Use AWS Security Hub and AWS Config to monitor compliance with security policies and industry standards.           |




A customerâ€™s ECS tasks keep failing. What could be the root cause?

# Troubleshooting ECS Tasks Failing

| Step No | Checkpoint                                      | Action/Command |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **1**   | **Check Task Logs**                            | Use **CloudWatch Logs** or `aws ecs describe-tasks` to view logs for failures. |
| **2**   | **Verify Container Exit Codes**                | Run `aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --tasks <task-id>` and check the `exitCode`. |
| **3**   | **Check Task Definitions**                     | Ensure correct image, CPU, memory limits, and essential containers are defined properly. |
| **4**   | **Inspect IAM Permissions**                    | Verify that the **ECS task role** has permissions for AWS services it interacts with. |
| **5**   | **Check for Port Conflicts**                   | Ensure that no conflicting ports are used in the task definition (especially for host mode). |
| **6**   | **Verify Networking Configuration**            | Ensure tasks are in the correct VPC/subnets and security groups allow inbound/outbound traffic. |
| **7**   | **Examine Load Balancer Health Checks**        | If using an ALB/NLB, check **target group health checks** under **EC2 > Target Groups**. |
| **8**   | **Check Service Auto Scaling Limits**          | If using ECS Service Auto Scaling, verify that the service has available capacity to launch tasks. |
| **9**   | **Look for Resource Constraints**              | If running on EC2 mode, check instance



| **Step** | **Description** | **AWS CLI Command** |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **1. Check Task Logs** | View logs from CloudWatch to diagnose app issues. | `aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name <log-group> --log-stream-name <log-stream>` |
| **2. Inspect Task Events** | Check service-level events for failures or warnings. | `aws ecs describe-services --cluster <cluster-name> --services <service-name>` |
| **3. Review Task Definition** | Validate image, env vars, ports, and resource allocations. | `aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <task-def-name>` |
| **4. Verify Networking** | Confirm subnet, VPC, and security group configs. | `aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces` or `aws ec2 describe-security-groups` |
| **5. Examine IAM Roles** | Ensure correct permissions for task and service roles. | `aws iam get-role --role-name <role-name>` |
| **6. Health Checks** | Check ALB target group health and ECS container checks. | `aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <arn>` |
| **7. Describe Task Failures** | Get task status, stopped reason, and exit code. | `aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --tasks <task-id>` |
| **8. Check Service Scaling** | Review desired vs running tasks and scaling settings. | `aws application-autoscaling describe-scalable-targets --service-namespace ecs` |
| **9. Confirm Image Registry Access** | Ensure ECS can pull images from ECR or private registries. | `aws ecr describe-repositories` and check logs for pull errors. |
| **10. Check Task Logs via Console** | (Alternative) Navigate via ECS > Task > Logs to see output. | N/A (Console-based) |



| **Step** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| **1. Define Task Definition** | You create a task definition which includes container image, CPU/memory, ports, and environment variables. |
| **2. Create ECS Cluster** | ECS clusters group your services/tasks and allow you to run them on EC2 (EC2 launch type) or Fargate (serverless). |
| **3. Deploy Service** | You deploy the service using the task definition to run and maintain a specified number of task instances. |
| **4. Service Scheduler** | ECS service scheduler ensures the desired count of tasks are running, and restarts tasks on failure. |
| **5. Load Balancer Integration** | Optionally integrate with ALB/NLB to distribute traffic across running tasks, with health checks. |
| **6. Auto Scaling** | ECS can scale the number of tasks up/down based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics via Application Auto Scaling. |
| **7. Task Placement Strategy** | ECS uses strategies (e.g., spread, binpack, random) to place tasks across Availability Zones and instances. |
| **8. Monitoring & Logging** | ECS integrates with CloudWatch for logs, metrics, and alarms to monitor application and service health. |



| **Aspect**           | **ECS Task**                                              | **ECS Service**                                                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | A task is a running container created from a task definition. | A service manages and runs tasks continuously as per desired count. |
| **Use Case**          | Used for one-time or batch jobs.                          | Used for long-running applications (e.g., web apps, APIs).        |
| **Auto-Restart**      | If the task stops, it won't restart automatically.        | Automatically restarts tasks if they fail or stop.               |
| **Load Balancer Support** | Not directly connected to load balancer.                  | Can be attached to a load balancer to distribute traffic.        |



| **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)** | - Implement CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy for automated build, test, and deployment of ECS container images.<br>- Integrate CI/CD pipelines with code repositories and Docker registries for seamless deployment. |
