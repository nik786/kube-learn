|---------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **1**   | **Check Task Logs**                            | Use **CloudWatch Logs** or `aws ecs describe-tasks` to view logs for failures. |
| **2**   | **Verify Container Exit Codes**                | Run `aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --tasks <task-id>` and check the `exitCode`. |
| **3**   | **Check Task Definitions**                     | Ensure correct image, CPU, memory limits, and essential containers are defined properly. |
| **4**   | **Inspect IAM Permissions**                    | Verify that the **ECS task role** has permissions for AWS services it interacts with. |
| **5**   | **Check for Port Conflicts**                   | Ensure that no conflicting ports are used in the task definition (especially for host mode). |
| **6**   | **Verify Networking Configuration**            | Ensure tasks are in the correct VPC/subnets and security groups allow inbound/outbound traffic. |
| **7**   | **Examine Load Balancer Health Checks**        | If using an ALB/NLB, check **target group health checks** under **EC2 > Target Groups**. |
| **8**   | **Check Service Auto Scaling Limits**          | If using ECS Service Auto Scaling, verify that the service has available capacity to launch tasks. |
| **9**   | **Look for Resource Constraints**              | If running on EC2 mode, check instance



An EC2 instance has high CPU utilization. How do you troubleshoot and optimize it?

# Troubleshooting High CPU Utilization in EC2

| Step No | Checkpoint                                      | Action/Command |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **1**   | **Check CPU Utilization Metrics**              | Use **CloudWatch**: `aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace AWS/EC2 --statistics Average --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=<instance-id>` |
| **2**   | **Identify High CPU Processes**                | Run `top` or `htop` to check which processes are consuming CPU. |
| **3**   | **Analyze System Load**                        | Run `uptime` or `vmstat` to check load averages. |
| **4**   | **Check for Overprovisioning**                 | If the instance is consistently under stress, consider **scaling up (vertical scaling)** or distributing the workload. |
| **5**   | **Optimize Application & Process Usage**       | Identify inefficient code, high CPU-consuming applications, or excessive logging. |
| **6**   | **Review Auto Scaling Configuration**          | If part of an **Auto Scaling Group**, ensure scaling policies allow adding more instances when needed. |
| **7**   | **Use CPU Credits (Burstable Instances)**      | For **T2/T3 instances**, check `CPUCreditBalance` in **CloudWatch**. Upgrade to a compute-optimized instance if needed. |
| **8**   | **Enable Enhanced Networking**                 | Enable **ENA (Elastic Network Adapter)** for better performance: `ethtool -i eth0` |
| **9**   | **Check for Background Cron Jobs**             | Run `crontab -l` and `systemctl list-timers` to see scheduled jobs consuming CPU. |
| **10**  | **Upgrade to a More Powerful Instance**        | If all optimizations fail, consider moving to a **larger instance type** (`t3.medium â†’ t3.large`). |
| **11**  | **Enable CPU-Based Auto Scaling (if applicable)** | Configure **AWS Auto Scaling** to launch additional instances when CPU utilization exceeds a threshold. |
| **12**  | **Use a Load Balancer (if multiple instances)** | Distribute traffic across multiple instances using an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**. |

This step-by-step guide ensures a structured approach to troubleshooting **high CPU utilization in EC2**. ðŸš€




A user is unable to attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance. What could be wrong?

# Troubleshooting: Unable to Attach an EBS Volume to EC2

| Step No | Checkpoint                                      | Possible Issue & Solution |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **1**   | **Check Volume State**                        | Run `aws ec2 describe-volumes --volume-ids <volume-id>`. Ensure the volume is in **"available"** state. If it's **"in-use"**, detach it first. |
| **2**   | **Verify EC2 and EBS Are in the Same AZ**     | EBS volumes must be in the **same Availability Zone (AZ)** as the EC2 instance. Run `aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>` and `aws ec2 describe-volumes --volume-ids <volume-id>` to check. |
| **3**   | **Check Instance Type Support**               | Some instance types (e.g., `t2.micro`) have **storage limitations**. Verify if your instance supports the volume type. |
| **4**   | **Confirm IAM Permissions**                   | Ensure the user has `ec2:AttachVolume` permission. Check IAM roles using `aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name <role-name>`. |
| **5**   | **Check Volume Size Limitations**             | The maximum volume size varies based on the instance type. Ensure it doesn't exceed the allowed limit. |
| **6**   | **Check Device Name Format**                  | The device name must follow correct format (`/dev/sdf`, `/dev/xvdf`, etc.). Incorrect naming can cause failures. |
| **7**   | **Verify if Another Instance Is Using It**    | Run `aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=block-device-mapping.volume-id,Values=<volume-id>` to check if another instance has already attached it. |
| **8**   | **Detach and Reattach the Volume**            | If stuck in "attaching" state, **detach and retry**: `aws ec2 detach-volume --volume-id <volume-id>` then `aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id <volume-id> --instance-id <instance-id> --device /dev/xvdf`. |
| **9**   | **Check System Logs on EC2**                  | If attached but not recognized, check `dmesg | grep -i sd` or `lsblk` to see if the OS detects the volume. |
| **10**  | **Format and Mount the Volume (if new)**      | New volumes need formatting: `sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf` and mounting: `sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt`. |

### Conclusion:
Following these **debugging steps** will help resolve EBS volume attachment issues and ensure a smooth attachment process. ðŸš€

# Optimizing DynamoDB Query Latency Issues

| Step No | Checkpoint                                      | Possible Issue & Solution |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **1**   | **Check Read/Write Capacity Mode**            | If using **Provisioned mode**, ensure you have sufficient `ReadCapacityUnits` and `WriteCapacityUnits`. Consider switching to **On-Demand mode** for unpredictable traffic. |
| **2**   | **Enable Auto-Scaling**                       | Configure auto-scaling for read/write capacity to handle traffic spikes dynamically. |
| **3**   | **Use Query Instead of Scan**                 | **Scan operations** are slower as they read the entire table. Use **Query** with partition keys for faster retrieval. |
| **4**   | **Optimize Partition Key Selection**          | A poorly chosen partition key can lead to **hot partitions**. Ensure even data distribution to avoid throttling. |
| **5**   | **Use Global & Local Secondary Indexes (GSI, LSI)** | Indexes improve performance by enabling additional query patterns without scanning the entire table. |
| **6**   | **Reduce Response Size with ProjectionExpression** | Retrieve only the required attributes instead of full item data: `ProjectionExpression='attribute1, attribute2'`. |
| **7**   | **Use Parallel Scans for Large Datasets**     | If `Scan` is necessary, enable **Parallel Scan** to distribute the workload across multiple threads. |
| **8**   | **Check CloudWatch Metrics**                  | Analyze **ReadThrottleEvents**, **WriteThrottleEvents**, and **ConsumedReadCapacityUnits** to identify bottlenecks. |
| **9**   | **Implement Exponential Backoff for Retries** | If queries are throttled, use exponential backoff to retry requests efficiently. |
| **10**  | **Use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)**            | If experiencing frequent reads, enable **DAX** to cache results and reduce query latency. |

### Conclusion:
By following these **optimization strategies**, you can **reduce query latency** and ensure **efficient DynamoDB performance**. ðŸš€
