|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enable Caching**                             | Use API Gateway's built-in caching at the stage level.                          | Reduces backend calls by serving cached responses, improving speed.                  |
| **Use Regional Endpoints**                     | Deploy APIs with regional endpoints instead of edge-optimized when global reach isn't needed. | Reduces DNS and network latency for localized users.                                 |
| **Enable Compression**                         | Enable gzip compression for responses.                                          | Reduces payload size for faster transmission.                                         |
| **Reduce Payload Size**                        | Minimize size of JSON/XML payloads and avoid sending unnecessary data.          | Faster network transfer and parsing.                                                  |
| **Use Direct Integrations**                    | Integrate directly with AWS services (like DynamoDB, S3) instead of Lambda.     | Avoids extra compute layers, reducing processing time.                                |
| **Optimize Lambda Functions**                  | Reduce cold start time (use smaller packages, provisioned concurrency).         | Quicker execution improves overall response time.                                     |
| **Batch Requests**                             | Combine multiple operations into a single API call.                             | Reduces the number of requests and processing overhead.                               |
| **Optimize Database Queries**                  | Tune queries, use indexes, avoid N+1 patterns, and reduce joins.                | Reduces backend DB response time, speeding up the overall API.                        |
| **Optimize ECS Services**                      | Right-size tasks, enable autoscaling, ensure warm containers.                   | Improves container start-up time and maintains consistent performance.                |
| **Use S3 Multipart Upload/Download**           | For large files, use multipart techniques.                                      | Improves transfer performance and reliability, especially for media-heavy APIs.       |
| **Configure Throttling and Rate Limits**       | Protect backend systems using appropriate request limits.                       | Prevents overloads and helps maintain consistent response times.                      |
| **Enable Keep-Alive in VPC Links**             | Reuse connections with keep-alive for private integrations.                     | Reduces TCP overhead, lowering response latency.                                      |
| **Use HTTP APIs Instead of REST APIs**         | Choose HTTP APIs if full REST features aren't required.                         | Provides faster, more cost-efficient routing.                                         |
| **Use AWS X-Ray & CloudWatch**                 | Trace and monitor request flow and identify bottlenecks.                        | Helps optimize where delays occur (e.g., Lambda, DB, ECS).                            |
| **Use Fargate with Provisioned Concurrency**   | Avoid cold starts and autoscale based on traffic.                               | Ensures fast and consistent response for containerized APIs.                          |
| **Use Asynchronous Processing (e.g., Kafka, SQS, EventBridge)** | Decouple heavy workloads from the main request path.           | Speeds up response by handing off tasks to be processed in the background.            |
| **Use Internal ALB via VPC Links**             | Connect APIGW to ECS/EKS services through internal ALB over VPC Link.           | Faster and more secure backend access with lower latency in private networks.         |




What are AWS Lambda Layers, and how do they improve function management?

| **Aspect**                     | **Description**                                                                 |

| **What Are Lambda Layers?**   | Lambda Layers are a way to manage and share common code (libraries, config, or dependencies) across multiple Lambda functions. |
| **Purpose**                   | Promote reuse of code and keep Lambda functions lightweight and maintainable.   |
| **How They Work**             | A layer is uploaded separately and referenced in the Lambda function; during runtime, it's merged into the `/opt` directory. |
| **Improves Code Reusability** | Common libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Boto3) can be packaged once and used across multiple functions. |
| **Simplifies Updates**        | You can update a layer version without modifying the main function logic.      |
| **Reduces Deployment Package Size** | Helps keep deployment packages small and focused only on function logic.         |
| **Supports Multiple Layers**  | A function can include up to **5 layers**, along with the deployment package.  |
| **Ideal Use Cases**           | Shared libraries, custom runtime binaries, configuration files, monitoring agents. |
| **Better CI/CD Practice**     | Layers can be version-controlled and deployed independently, aligning with DevOps best practices. |
