|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enable Caching**                     | Use API Gateway's built-in caching at the stage level.                          | Reduces backend calls by serving cached responses, improving speed.                  |
| **Use Regional Endpoints**             | Deploy APIs with regional endpoints instead of edge-optimized when global reach isn't needed. | Reduces DNS and network latency for localized users.                                 |
| **Enable Compression**                 | Enable gzip compression for responses.                                          | Reduces payload size for faster transmission.                                         |
| **Reduce Payload Size**                | Minimize size of JSON/XML payloads and avoid sending unnecessary data.          | Faster network transfer and parsing.                                                  |
| **Use Direct Integrations**            | Integrate directly with AWS services (like DynamoDB, S3) instead of Lambda.     | Avoids extra compute layers, reducing processing time.                                |
| **Optimize Lambda Functions**          | Reduce cold start time (use smaller packages, provisioned concurrency).         | Quicker execution improves overall response time.                                     |
| **Batch Requests**                     | Combine multiple operations into a single API call.                             | Reduces the number of requests and processing overhead.                               |
| **Optimize Database Queries**          | Tune queries, use indexes, avoid N+1 patterns, and reduce joins.                | Reduces backend DB response time, speeding up the overall API.                        |
| **Optimize ECS Services**              | Right-size tasks, enable autoscaling, ensure warm containers.                   | Improves container start-up time and maintains consistent performance.                |
| **Use S3 Multipart Upload/Download**   | For large files, use multipart techniques.                                      | Improves transfer performance and reliability, especially for media-heavy APIs.       |
| **Configure Throttling and Rate Limits** | Protect backend systems using appropriate request limits.                      | Prevents overloads and helps maintain consistent response times.                      |
| **Enable Keep-Alive in VPC Links**     | Reuse connections with keep-alive for private integrations.                     | Reduces TCP overhead, lowering response latency.                                      |
| **Use HTTP APIs Instead of REST APIs** | Choose HTTP APIs if full REST features aren't required.                         | Provides faster, more cost-efficient routing.                                         |
| **Use AWS X-Ray & CloudWatch**         | Trace and monitor request flow and identify bottlenecks.                        | Helps optimize where delays occur (e.g., Lambda, DB, ECS).                            |
| **Use Fargate with Provisioned Concurrency (for APIs on ECS)** | Avoid cold starts and autoscale based on traffic.                   | Ensures fast and consistent response for containerized APIs.                          |
