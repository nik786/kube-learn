| **1. Account Structure**         | Organize accounts by function (e.g., Security, Logging, Dev, Prod) using AWS Organizations. |
| **2. Identity & Access Management** | Implement centralized IAM via AWS SSO or IAM Identity Center for secure access control. |
| **3. Networking**                | Design a scalable VPC structure with private/public subnets, NAT gateways, and Transit Gateway. |
| **4. Security Baseline**        | Enforce Guardrails using AWS Control Tower, SCPs, and security services like AWS Config and CloudTrail. |
| **5. Logging & Monitoring**      | Centralize logs using AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and AWS Config in a dedicated logging account. |
| **6. Automation & CI/CD**       | Use Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) for repeatable and consistent deployments. |
| **7. Cost Management**           | Implement budget alarms, tagging strategy, and cost explorer for visibility and governance. |
| **8. Compliance & Governance**   | Apply service control policies, encryption, and region restrictions to meet compliance requirements. |

## AWS Multi-Account Management and Switching Methods  

### **How Many AWS Accounts Have You Managed?**  
I have managed **4â€“6 AWS accounts** in my project, covering:  
- **Development (Dev)**
- **Staging (Stage/UAT)**
- **Production (Prod)**
- **Security & Compliance**
- **Logging & Monitoring**
- **Shared Services**

### **Methods to Switch Between AWS Accounts**  

| **Method**               | **Description** | **Brief Process** |
|--------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **STS (Security Token Service)** | Enables temporary access to assume roles in other AWS accounts. | 1. Create an IAM role in the target account with necessary permissions.<br>2. Use `aws sts assume-role` to switch roles programmatically.<br>3. Retrieve temporary credentials and use them for API calls. |
| **AWS Organizations** | Centralized account management with consolidated billing and SCP (Service Control Policies). | 1. Create an AWS Organization and invite accounts.<br>2. Apply SCPs to enforce policies.<br>3. Use AWS SSO or IAM roles to access multiple accounts. |
| **AWS Control Tower** | Automates multi-account setup with best practices and guardrails. | 1. Deploy Control Tower to manage account lifecycle.<br>2. Use AWS SSO for account switching.<br>3. Enforce security guardrails and compliance policies. |
| **AWS Service Catalog** | Enables cross-account infrastructure provisioning via pre-approved CloudFormation templates. | 1. Create and share product portfolios across accounts.<br>2. Grant access to users/roles.<br>3. Launch services from the catalog without manual setup. |
| **Trust Relationships** | Establishes cross-account access by defining IAM role trust policies. | 1. Create an IAM role in the target account.<br>2. Modify the trust policy to allow access from another AWS account.<br>3. Assume the role via AWS CLI, SDK, or console. |
| **SCP (Service Control Policies)** | Restricts or allows specific actions across AWS accounts in an Organization. | 1. Define an SCP policy with allowed/denied actions.<br>2. Attach SCP to an AWS Organizational Unit (OU) or specific account.<br>3. Ensure IAM roles align with SCP permissions. |
