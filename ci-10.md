Question 9: Explain the pipeline of your project and its purpose.


# CI/CD Pipeline Overview

| **Pipeline Stage**              | **Description**                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Source Code Management**    | - Developers push code to Git repositories. <br> - Merge requests trigger reviews and initiate the pipeline.   |
| **2. Continuous Integration (CI)**| - **Automated Testing:** Unit and integration tests run using frameworks like JUnit or pytest. <br> - **Static Analysis:** Tools like SonarQube check code quality and security. |
| **3. Build Process**             | - **Dockerization:** Applications containerized using Docker. <br> - **Artifact Storage:** Built images stored in a private registry. |
| **4. Continuous Deployment (CD)**| - **Staging Deployment:** Terraform and Ansible provision environments. <br> - Jenkins deploys to Kubernetes. <br> - **Automated Acceptance Testing:** End-to-end tests verify application functionality. |
| **5. Approval and Release**     | - **Manual Approval:** Stakeholders review before production deployment. <br> - **Change Management:** Documented via Jira tickets for traceability. |
| **6. Production Deployment**    | - **Blue-Green Strategy:** Minimizes downtime and allows quick rollback if necessary. <br> - **Secrets Management:** Vault secures sensitive data during deployment. |
| **7. Post-Deployment Monitoring**| - **Logging:** ELK Stack aggregates logs for error analysis and debugging. <br> - **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana track application and system performance. |

## Purpose of the Pipeline

| **Purpose**               | **Description**                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automation and Efficiency** | Speeds up release cycles and ensures repeatable processes.                                            |
| **Quality Assurance**     | Automated testing maintains high-quality standards.                                                   |
| **Risk Mitigation**       | Strategies like blue-green deployments reduce downtime and impact of failures.                        |
