# Project Pipeline and Its Purpose

Our CI/CD pipeline automates and streamlines software delivery:

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Source Code Management
- Developers push code to Git repositories.
- Merge requests trigger reviews and initiate the pipeline.

### 2. Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Automated Testing:**
  - Unit and integration tests run using frameworks like JUnit or pytest.
- **Static Analysis:**
  - Tools like SonarQube check code quality and security.

### 3. Build Process
- **Dockerization:**
  - Applications containerized using Docker.
- **Artifact Storage:**
  - Built images stored in a private registry.

### 4. Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Staging Deployment:**
  - Terraform and Ansible provision environments.
  - Jenkins deploys to Kubernetes.
- **Automated Acceptance Testing:**
  - End-to-end tests verify application functionality.

### 5. Approval and Release
- **Manual Approval:**
  - Stakeholders review before production deployment.
- **Change Management:**
  - Documented via Jira tickets for traceability.

### 6. Production Deployment
- **Blue-Green Strategy:**
  - Minimizes downtime and allows quick rollback if necessary.
- **Secrets Management:**
  - Vault secures sensitive data during deployment.

### 7. Post-Deployment Monitoring
- **Logging:**
  - ELK Stack aggregates logs for error analysis and debugging.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Prometheus and Grafana track application and system performance.

## Purpose of the Pipeline

1. **Automation and Efficiency:**
   - Speeds up release cycles and ensures repeatable processes.
2. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Automated testing maintains high-quality standards.
3. **Risk Mitigation:**
   - Strategies like blue-green deployments reduce downtime and impact of failures.
