Users report that your website sometimes resolves to the wrong IP address. How would you diagnose this DNS issue?

| **Step** | **Description** |
|---------|---------------|
| **Check DNS Records** | Use `dig` or `nslookup` to verify A, CNAME, and other DNS records from your authoritative DNS provider. |
| **Verify TTL (Time-To-Live) Settings** | Ensure DNS records have an appropriate TTL value to prevent outdated cache issues. |
| **Test from Different Locations** | Use `dig @8.8.8.8` (Google DNS) or online tools (e.g., MXToolbox, WhatsMyDNS) to check global DNS propagation. |
| **Flush Local DNS Cache** | Run `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows) or `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches` (Linux) to clear stale DNS entries. |
| **Inspect CDN & Load Balancer Configurations** | If using a CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai) or Load Balancer (AWS ALB/NLB), ensure correct backend IP mapping. |
| **Check Name Server Delegation** | Use `dig NS yourdomain.com` to verify the correct name servers are configured and propagated. |
| **Verify DNS Propagation Delay** | Use `dig +trace yourdomain.com` to check if updates are properly propagating through the DNS hierarchy. |
| **Inspect Cloud DNS Logs** | If using cloud DNS services (AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, Azure DNS), check logs for anomalies. |
| **Check Split-Horizon DNS Issues** | If using internal and external DNS, ensure they resolve to the correct IPs based on network context. |
| **Review Recent Changes** | If DNS records were recently updated, verify they were correctly applied and propagated. |
| **Monitor Anycast DNS Issues** | If using Anycast DNS, check for regional misconfigurations that might be directing users to incorrect endpoints. |
| **Test IPv4 vs. IPv6 Resolution** | Use `dig AAAA yourdomain.com` to check if incorrect IPv6 records are being returned. |
| **Use a Different Resolver** | Switch to a public DNS resolver (Google 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare 1.1.1.1) to rule out ISP DNS cache issues. |
| **Enable DNSSEC Validation** | Check if DNSSEC is enabled and properly configured to prevent DNS hijacking or cache poisoning. |
