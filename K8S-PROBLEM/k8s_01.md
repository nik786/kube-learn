Your Kubernetes cluster is being targeted by DDoS attacks. What security measures can you implement?

| **Security Measure**          | **Description** |
|------------------------------|---------------|
| **Rate Limiting** | Implement API Gateway (e.g., Nginx Ingress, Traefik) with rate limiting to restrict excessive requests from a single IP. |
| **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** | Use AWS WAF, Cloudflare WAF, or ModSecurity to filter out malicious traffic before it reaches your cluster. |
| **Node Auto-Scaling** | Configure Cluster Autoscaler to dynamically scale nodes to handle increased load efficiently. |
| **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** | Automatically scale pods based on CPU/memory usage to absorb sudden spikes in traffic. |
| **Network Policies** | Restrict internal and external communication using Kubernetes Network Policies to allow only necessary traffic. |
| **Ingress Controller Protections** | Enable DDoS protection at the Ingress level (e.g., use Cloudflare, AWS ALB with AWS Shield). |
| **IP Whitelisting & Blacklisting** | Use firewall rules (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure NSGs) to block malicious IPs. |
| **Cloud Provider DDoS Protection** | Enable DDoS protection services like AWS Shield, Azure DDoS Protection, or GCP Cloud Armor. |
| **Pod Security Policies (PSP) or OPA/Gatekeeper** | Restrict container capabilities to prevent attackers from exploiting pods. |
| **Limit Load Balancer Exposure** | Avoid exposing Kubernetes LoadBalancer services directly to the internet; use a reverse proxy or API Gateway. |
| **TCP SYN Cookies & Connection Limits** | Enable SYN cookies and set connection limits at the kernel level to prevent SYN flood attacks. |
| **Enable Logging & Monitoring** | Use Prometheus + Grafana, ELK stack, or cloud-native solutions to monitor unusual traffic patterns. |
| **Implement mTLS (Mutual TLS)** | Secure internal communication between services using Istio, Linkerd, or Consul for service mesh security. |
| **Use a CDN** | Deploy a CDN like Cloudflare, Akamai, or AWS CloudFront to absorb and filter bad traffic before it reaches your cluster. |
| **DNS Rate Limiting** | If using an external DNS, configure rate limiting to prevent DNS amplification attacks. |



You suspect that an attacker is trying to scan your cloud environment. How do you detect and prevent such activity?



| **Method** | **Description** |
|------------|---------------|
| **Enable Cloud Logging & Monitoring** | Use cloud-native logging tools (AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, GCP Cloud Logging) to track unusual activity. |
| **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** | Deploy IDS/IPS solutions like AWS GuardDuty, Azure Defender, or GCP Security Command Center to detect scanning patterns. |
| **VPC Flow Logs & Network Monitoring** | Analyze VPC Flow Logs to identify suspicious inbound/outbound traffic and block malicious IPs. |
| **Rate Limiting & WAF** | Use Web Application Firewalls (AWS WAF, Cloudflare, Azure WAF) with rate limiting to prevent automated scans. |
| **Network Security Groups (NSGs) & Security Groups** | Restrict inbound and outbound traffic using cloud security groups (AWS SGs, Azure NSGs, GCP VPC Firewall Rules). |
| **Geo-IP Blocking** | Block traffic from high-risk regions using firewall rules, AWS Shield, or Cloudflare security settings. |
| **IAM Policy Restrictions** | Limit access to cloud resources using least privilege principles (IAM roles, permissions, and MFA enforcement). |
| **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** | Deploy tools like AWS Inspector, CrowdStrike, or Microsoft Defender for advanced endpoint threat detection. |
| **Honeypots** | Deploy decoy resources (e.g., Canary tokens, TPot honeypots) to detect attackers' scanning attempts. |
| **Alerting & Incident Response** | Set up alerts (AWS SNS, Azure Security Center, GCP Cloud Functions) to notify security teams of suspicious activities. |
| **Restrict Public Endpoints** | Avoid exposing cloud services (databases, storage, Kubernetes API) directly to the internet unless necessary. |
| **Use Private Networking & Zero Trust** | Implement Zero Trust networking with VPNs, VPC peering, and private endpoints to reduce attack surface. |
| **Automated Threat Remediation** | Use AWS Lambda, Azure Logic Apps, or GCP Cloud Functions to auto-block scanning IPs based on logs. |
