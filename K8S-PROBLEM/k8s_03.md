Users report that your website sometimes resolves to the wrong IP address. How would you diagnose this DNS issue?

| **Step** | **Description** |
|---------|---------------|
| **Check DNS Records** | Use `dig` or `nslookup` to verify A, CNAME, and other DNS records from your authoritative DNS provider. |
| **Verify TTL (Time-To-Live) Settings** | Ensure DNS records have an appropriate TTL value to prevent outdated cache issues. |
| **Test from Different Locations** | Use `dig @8.8.8.8` (Google DNS) or online tools (e.g., MXToolbox, WhatsMyDNS) to check global DNS propagation. |
| **Flush Local DNS Cache** | Run `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows) or `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches` (Linux) to clear stale DNS entries. |
| **Inspect CDN & Load Balancer Configurations** | If using a CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai) or Load Balancer (AWS ALB/NLB), ensure correct backend IP mapping. |
| **Check Name Server Delegation** | Use `dig NS yourdomain.com` to verify the correct name servers are configured and propagated. |
| **Verify DNS Propagation Delay** | Use `dig +trace yourdomain.com` to check if updates are properly propagating through the DNS hierarchy. |
| **Inspect Cloud DNS Logs** | If using cloud DNS services (AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, Azure DNS), check logs for anomalies. |
| **Check Split-Horizon DNS Issues** | If using internal and external DNS, ensure they resolve to the correct IPs based on network context. |
| **Review Recent Changes** | If DNS records were recently updated, verify they were correctly applied and propagated. |
| **Monitor Anycast DNS Issues** | If using Anycast DNS, check for regional misconfigurations that might be directing users to incorrect endpoints. |
| **Test IPv4 vs. IPv6 Resolution** | Use `dig AAAA yourdomain.com` to check if incorrect IPv6 records are being returned. |
| **Use a Different Resolver** | Switch to a public DNS resolver (Google 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare 1.1.1.1) to rule out ISP DNS cache issues. |
| **Enable DNSSEC Validation** | Check if DNSSEC is enabled and properly configured to prevent DNS hijacking or cache poisoning. |



Your team deployed a DNS change, but some users still resolve to the old IP. How do you ensure a smooth transition?

| **Step** | **Description** |
|---------|---------------|
| **Lower TTL Before Change** | Reduce the DNS record's TTL (e.g., to 300s) **before** making changes to allow faster propagation. |
| **Verify DNS Record Update** | Use `dig`, `nslookup`, or online tools (e.g., MXToolbox, WhatsMyDNS) to confirm correct records at authoritative name servers. |
| **Check Global Propagation** | Use `dig +trace yourdomain.com` or online tools like `whatsmydns.net` to track propagation status worldwide. |
| **Flush Local & Server DNS Cache** | Run `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows) or `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches` (Linux) to clear stale entries. |
| **Restart Browsers & Devices** | Ask users to restart their browsers, devices, or use Incognito mode to bypass cached DNS. |
| **Monitor DNS Logs & Analytics** | If using a managed DNS provider (AWS Route 53, Cloudflare, Google Cloud DNS), check query logs for anomalies. |
| **Use Load Balancer or Failover** | Route traffic through a Load Balancer or use DNS failover (Route 53 Failover Routing) for a seamless transition. |
| **Test from Different Locations** | Use `dig @8.8.8.8 yourdomain.com` (Google DNS) or VPNs to check from various regions. |
| **Verify CDN Configuration** | If using a CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai), ensure it updates the origin IP correctly and doesn't cache old records. |
| **Communicate with Users** | Notify users about the change and suggest switching to a public DNS resolver (Google 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare 1.1.1.1) if needed. |
| **Ensure Reverse DNS (PTR) Matches** | If applicable, update reverse DNS (PTR records) to reflect the new IP for email and security purposes. |
| **Gradual Rollback Plan** | If issues arise, ensure the old IP remains functional for some time to prevent service disruption. |




A DNS lookup takes too long, impacting API response times. What optimizations can you apply?

| **Optimization** | **Description** |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Reduce DNS TTL for Critical Services** | Lower TTL values for frequently updated records to ensure faster resolution without excessive caching. |
| **Use a Local DNS Resolver** | Deploy a local DNS caching resolver (e.g., `Unbound`, `dnsmasq`) to speed up repeated queries. |
| **Enable DNS Prefetching** | Configure clients and browsers to prefetch domain resolutions for frequently accessed APIs. |
| **Use Persistent Connections** | Implement keep-alive connections (`HTTP/2`, `gRPC`) to avoid repeated DNS lookups per request. |
| **Reduce CNAME Chaining** | Minimize the number of CNAME records to decrease resolution time. |
| **Optimize CDN & Load Balancer DNS Settings** | If using Cloudflare, AWS Route 53, or Akamai, ensure DNS caching and edge locations are properly configured. |
| **Use a Faster Public DNS Resolver** | Switch to low-latency resolvers like `Google (8.8.8.8)`, `Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)`, or `Quad9 (9.9.9.9)`. |
| **Enable DNS Caching on Application Layer** | Implement DNS caching at the application level (e.g., Nginx, Envoy) to avoid redundant queries. |
| **Deploy DNS Load Balancing** | Use DNS-based load balancing (AWS Route 53 Latency-Based Routing, GCP Cloud DNS) to serve users from the nearest region. |
| **Monitor DNS Query Performance** | Use `dig +trace`, `nslookup`, or cloud DNS logs to analyze query resolution times. |
| **Reduce External API Dependencies** | Minimize the number of external API calls requiring DNS resolution. |
| **Verify Network Latency to DNS Server** | Use `ping` or `traceroute` to check connectivity issues with the DNS resolver. |
| **Optimize Recursive DNS Resolution** | If using an internal DNS resolver, ensure it is well-configured to resolve queries efficiently. |
| **Implement Anycast DNS** | Use Anycast DNS services (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS) for globally distributed low-latency resolution. |




Your API Gateway is not forwarding requests to backend services correctly. What troubleshooting steps do you follow?

| **Step** | **Description** |
|---------|---------------|
| **Check API Gateway Logs** | Review logs in AWS API Gateway (CloudWatch Logs), Azure API Management, or GCP API Gateway logs for errors. |
| **Test API Gateway Endpoint** | Use `curl -v`, Postman, or a browser to manually send a request and inspect the response. |
