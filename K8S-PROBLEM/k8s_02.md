A production system experiences random network outages, but there are no alerts in your monitoring tool. What steps do you take?


| **Step** | **Description** |
|---------|---------------|
| **Check System Logs** | Review logs from affected services using ELK Stack, CloudWatch, or Splunk for error patterns. |
| **Analyze Network Traffic** | Use `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`, or cloud provider flow logs (AWS VPC Flow Logs, Azure NSG Logs) to inspect traffic patterns. |
| **Test Network Connectivity** | Run `ping`, `traceroute`, or `mtr` to check for packet loss and latency issues. |
| **Verify Load Balancer Health** | Ensure the load balancer (AWS ALB/NLB, Azure Traffic Manager, GCP Load Balancer) is routing traffic correctly and not failing health checks. |
| **Inspect DNS Resolution** | Run `nslookup` or `dig` to check if DNS failures are causing intermittent outages. |
| **Check Firewall & Security Groups** | Ensure firewall rules, security groups, or Kubernetes Network Policies are not blocking connections intermittently. |
| **Investigate Service Mesh & Ingress Controller** | If using Istio, Linkerd, or an Ingress controller, check for policy misconfigurations or timeouts. |
| **Review Autoscaling Events** | Check if auto-scaling (HPA, Cluster Autoscaler) is terminating healthy instances unexpectedly. |
| **Look for Resource Exhaustion** | Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage in affected nodes/pods to detect resource exhaustion issues. |
| **Verify Cloud Provider Status** | Check AWS, Azure, or GCP status pages for any ongoing outages affecting your region. |
| **Enable More Detailed Logging** | Increase logging verbosity in application and network layers to capture transient failures. |
| **Use Synthetic Monitoring** | Set up synthetic monitoring (e.g., Pingdom, AWS Route 53 Health Checks) to catch outages proactively. |
| **Check NAT Gateway & Proxies** | Ensure NAT Gateways, VPNs, or proxy servers are not throttling or blocking traffic intermittently. |
| **Implement Redundancy & Failover** | Configure multi-region failover, redundant network paths, and failover DNS to improve resilience. |
