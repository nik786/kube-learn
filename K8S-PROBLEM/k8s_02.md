Your microservices application has high network latency between services. How do you identify the bottleneck?


| **Troubleshooting Step** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Enable Distributed Tracing** | Use tools like Jaeger, Zipkin, or AWS X-Ray to trace requests and find slow services. |
| **Monitor Service Metrics** | Use Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to track request latencies, response times, and throughput. |
| **Check Network Policies & Security Groups** | Ensure Kubernetes Network Policies, AWS Security Groups, or firewall rules are not restricting or slowing traffic. |
| **Analyze Logs** | Review application logs (ELK stack, CloudWatch, Fluentd) for slow request patterns or errors. |
| **Test Network Latency** | Use `ping`, `traceroute`, `mtr`, or `iperf` to check network delays between services. |
| **Use Service Mesh for Observability** | Deploy Istio, Linkerd, or Consul to monitor and optimize inter-service communication. |
| **Check Load Balancer & DNS Resolution** | Investigate whether DNS resolution (e.g., Kubernetes CoreDNS) or misconfigured load balancers are causing delays. |
| **Optimize API Calls** | Identify inefficient synchronous calls and replace them with asynchronous communication (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ). |
| **Inspect Pod Scheduling** | Ensure related microservices are scheduled on the same node or availability zone to reduce cross-zone latency. |
| **Reduce Unnecessary Hops** | Minimize service-to-service hops by consolidating functionality or using caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached). |
| **Monitor Container Resource Usage** | High CPU/memory usage can slow response times; check Kubernetes pod limits and resource requests. |
| **Optimize TLS Overhead** | If using mTLS (e.g., Istio), check for excessive encryption overhead; use TLS termination at ingress. |
| **Check Database Query Performance** | If services rely on databases, analyze slow queries with tools like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for SQL. |
| **Enable Connection Pooling** | Use database and API connection pooling to minimize excessive TCP handshakes and latency. |


A production system experiences random network outages, but there are no alerts in your monitoring tool. What steps do you take?


| **Step** | **Description** |
|---------|---------------|
| **Check System Logs** | Review logs from affected services using ELK Stack, CloudWatch, or Splunk for error patterns. |
| **Analyze Network Traffic** | Use `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`, or cloud provider flow logs (AWS VPC Flow Logs, Azure NSG Logs) to inspect traffic patterns. |
| **Test Network Connectivity** | Run `ping`, `traceroute`, or `mtr` to check for packet loss and latency issues. |
| **Verify Load Balancer Health** | Ensure the load balancer (AWS ALB/NLB, Azure Traffic Manager, GCP Load Balancer) is routing traffic correctly and not failing health checks. |
| **Inspect DNS Resolution** | Run `nslookup` or `dig` to check if DNS failures are causing intermittent outages. |
| **Check Firewall & Security Groups** | Ensure firewall rules, security groups, or Kubernetes Network Policies are not blocking connections intermittently. |
| **Investigate Service Mesh & Ingress Controller** | If using Istio, Linkerd, or an Ingress controller, check for policy misconfigurations or timeouts. |
| **Review Autoscaling Events** | Check if auto-scaling (HPA, Cluster Autoscaler) is terminating healthy instances unexpectedly. |
| **Look for Resource Exhaustion** | Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage in affected nodes/pods to detect resource exhaustion issues. |
| **Verify Cloud Provider Status** | Check AWS, Azure, or GCP status pages for any ongoing outages affecting your region. |
| **Enable More Detailed Logging** | Increase logging verbosity in application and network layers to capture transient failures. |
| **Use Synthetic Monitoring** | Set up synthetic monitoring (e.g., Pingdom, AWS Route 53 Health Checks) to catch outages proactively. |
| **Check NAT Gateway & Proxies** | Ensure NAT Gateways, VPNs, or proxy servers are not throttling or blocking traffic intermittently. |
| **Implement Redundancy & Failover** | Configure multi-region failover, redundant network paths, and failover DNS to improve resilience. |
