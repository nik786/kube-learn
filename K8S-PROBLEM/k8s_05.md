Your CI/CD pipeline fails due to network timeouts while pulling Docker images. 
What could be the cause, and how do you fix it?



| **Possible Cause**                  | **Description**                                                                 | **Solution**                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Missing Internet Access in Private Subnet** | EC2 instance in a private subnet without proper NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway. | Ensure your route table for the private subnet points to a NAT Gateway (for outbound HTTPS).<br>AWS CLI: `aws ec2 describe-route-tables`, `aws ec2 describe-nat-gateways` |
| **ECR Authentication Missing**     | EC2 agent isn't authenticated to pull from ECR.                                | Use AWS CLI: `aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com`                                  |
| **IAM Role Not Attached**          | The EC2 instance lacks necessary ECR permissions.                              | Attach an instance profile with `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly` or a custom policy allowing `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`, `ecr:BatchGetImage`, etc.<br>AWS CLI: `aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile --instance-id <id> --iam-instance-profile Name=<name>` |
| **DNS Resolution Problems**        | EC2 cannot resolve ECR endpoints.                                              | Use `nslookup` or `dig` on `*.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com`. Update `/etc/resolv.conf` or switch to `8.8.8.8` DNS temporarily.                                     |
| **Proxy or Firewall Blocking**     | EC2 is behind a proxy or restrictive security group/NACL.                      | Update proxy configs in Docker or EC2 environment. Ensure SGs allow HTTPS (443) and outbound traffic.<br>AWS CLI: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups`, `aws ec2 describe-network-acls` |
| **High EC2 Resource Utilization**  | EC2 agent is overloaded (CPU/memory/disk).                                     | Monitor with `top`, `htop`, or install CloudWatch agent.<br>AWS CLI: `aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics`                                                      |
| **Docker Daemon Misconfiguration** | Docker daemon has bad proxy settings or MTU mismatch.                          | Review `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. Ensure correct MTU (esp. for AWS VPC). Restart Docker with `sudo systemctl restart docker`.                                   |
| **ECR Throttling**                 | Too many image pulls in a short time from same IP or account.                  | Use ECR image caching in the pipeline. Minimize pull frequency using Docker layer caching or `docker pull` conditionally.                                         |
| **Large Docker Images**            | Large images slow down pulls and risk timeout.                                 | Optimize Dockerfiles: use minimal base images (e.g., `alpine`), remove unused layers, and apply multi-stage builds.                                              |
| **Pipeline Pulling Redundantly**   | Images are pulled in every stage without caching.                              | Add image cache layers or shared EBS volume for Docker cache. Use `--cache-from` in `docker build`.                                                              |
| **Old Docker Version on EC2**      | Older Docker versions may be inefficient or buggy with ECR auth.               | Upgrade Docker: `sudo yum update docker -y` (Amazon Linux), or use Docker’s install script.                                                                      |
| **ECR Service Outage**             | ECR itself may be experiencing regional downtime.                              | Check AWS Service Health Dashboard: [https://health.aws.amazon.com](https://health.aws.amazon.com). Retry with backoff logic in pipeline.                        |




| **Possible Cause** | **Description** | **Solution** |
|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| **High CPU or Memory Utilization** | Excessive CPU or RAM usage can slow down performance. | Check with `top` or `htop`, and optimize processes. Consider upgrading the instance type. |
| **Network Congestion** | High traffic on the network can cause delays. | Use `iftop` or `netstat` to check network usage. Consider switching to an instance with better network performance (e.g., ENA-enabled). |
| **Overloaded Disk I/O** | High read/write operations on disk can cause latency. | Monitor with `iostat` or `iotop`. Use SSD-backed EBS volumes (`gp3` or `io2`) for better performance. |
| **Improper Instance Type** | Some instance types may not be suitable for high-performance workloads. | Choose an instance optimized for your workload (e.g., compute-optimized `C` series or memory-optimized `R` series). |
| **AWS Placement Group Misconfiguration** | Without a placement group, inter-instance latency might be high. | Use placement groups (`cluster` type) for low-latency networking. |
| **Inefficient Security Group Rules** | Overly restrictive security group rules can delay packet processing. | Optimize security groups and use AWS VPC Flow Logs to diagnose issues. |
| **Outdated Kernel or OS** | An old kernel or OS can introduce performance bottlenecks. | Update OS and kernel (`sudo yum update -y` or `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`). |
| **Bad Network MTU Settings** | Incorrect MTU size can cause packet fragmentation and retransmission. | Set MTU to `9001` for Jumbo Frames on enhanced networking (`ip link set eth0 mtu 9001`). |
| **No Enhanced Networking** | Standard networking drivers may not be optimized for high-performance workloads. | Enable Enhanced Networking (`ENA` or `SR-IOV`) for better throughput. |
| **AWS Throttling or No Burst Credits** | EC2 instances (especially `t2/t3`) may experience CPU throttling. | Check `aws cloudwatch get-metric-data` for CPU credits and upgrade to `t3.unlimited` or `m5` series if needed. |
| **High Latency to External Services** | Calls to external APIs or databases can cause slowness. | Optimize DNS resolution, use VPC Endpoints, and enable caching where possible. |
| **Improper Load Balancing** | Unoptimized traffic routing can lead to high latency. | Use an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or Route 53 latency-based routing. |
| **DNS Resolution Delay** | Slow DNS lookups can impact application performance. | Use AWS Route 53 or Google’s `8.8.8.8` for faster lookups and enable DNS caching. |
| **Unoptimized Software Configuration** | Misconfigured applications or services can cause delays. | Profile application performance using `strace`, `perf`, or APM tools like AWS X-Ray. |
