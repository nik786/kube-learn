# Databases Used in the Project

We utilize a combination of databases for different purposes:

| **Database Type**      | **Database**      | **Usage**                                                                                       | **Example Use Cases**                              |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Relational Databases** | PostgreSQL        | Structured data requiring ACID compliance.                                                     | Stores transactional data critical to operations. |
| **NoSQL Databases**     | MongoDB           | Handles unstructured and semi-structured data with a flexible schema.                          | Stores user profiles, logs, and flexible data.    |
| **In-Memory Data Stores** | Redis            | Used for caching to improve performance.                                                       | Manages session data and real-time analytics.     |
| **Time-Series Databases** | InfluxDB         | Stores time-series data for monitoring metrics.                                                | Powers dashboards for real-time performance tracking. |
| **Data Warehousing**    | Amazon Redshift   | Consolidates data for business intelligence and supports complex analytical queries.            | Supports large-scale analytics and reporting.     |
