[jobs]
It can be used to reliably execute a workload until it completes.
The job will create one or more pods.
When the job is over the containers will exit and pods will enter completed state

This job calculates first 2000 digits of pi before exiting


[cronjobs]

It builds upon the functionality of jobs by allowing you to execute jobs according to schedule.

Cronjobs spec contains a schedule where we can specify a cron expression to determine when and how often the job will be 
executed.

It also contains jobTemplate where we can specify the job we want to run
