In Kubernetes, you can run multiple schedulers simultaneously. You can then use different 
schedulers to schedule different pods. You may, for example, want to set different rules 
for the scheduler to run all of your pods on one node. In this lesson, I will show you how 
to deploy a new scheduler alongside your default scheduler and then schedule 
three different pods using the two schedulers.

Run the deployment for my-scheduler:

kubectl create -f my-scheduler.yaml

View your new scheduler in the kube-system namespace:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system

kubectl get pods -o wide
