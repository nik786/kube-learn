The default scheduler in Kubernetes attempts to find the best node for your pod by going through a series of steps. In this lesson, we will cover the steps in detail in order to better understand the schedulerâ€™s function when placing pods on nodes to maximize uptime for the applications running in your cluster.

Label node 1 as being located in availability zone 1:

kubectl label node chadcrowell1c.mylabserver.com availability-zone=zone1

Label node 2 as being located in availability zone 2:

kubectl label node chadcrowell2c.mylabserver.com availability-zone=zone2

Label node 1 as dedicated infrastructure:

kubectl label node chadcrowell1c.mylabserver.com share-type=dedicated

Label node 2 as shared infrastructure:

kubectl label node chadcrowell2c.mylabserver.com share-type=shared

Create the deployment:

kubectl create -f pref-deployment.yaml

View the deployment:

kubectl get deployments

View which pods landed on which nodes:

kubectl get pods -o wide
