There are many ways to manage the logs that can accumulate from both applications and system components. In this lesson, weâ€™ll go through a few different approaches to organizing your logs.

The directory where the container logs reside:

/var/log/containers
The directory where kubelet stores its logs:

/var/log
The YAML for a pod that has two different log streams:


Create a pod that has two different log streams to the same directory:

kubectl apply -f twolog.yaml
View the logs in the /var/log directory of the container:

kubectl exec counter -- ls /var/log
The YAML for a sidecar container that will tail the logs for each type:

View the first type of logs separately:

kubectl logs counter count-log-1
View the second type of logs separately:

kubectl logs counter count-log-2
