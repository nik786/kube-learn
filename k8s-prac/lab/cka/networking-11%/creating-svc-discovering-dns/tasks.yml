Description
In this hands-on lab, you will be presented with a three-node cluster. You will be creating
a simple nginx deployment, in which you must create a service from that deployment.
In order to accomplish this, you will use the kubectl command line to create the deployment.
Then, you will expose the deployment to create the service. When you have verified
the service is up and running, you will create a busybox pod to test the DNS resolution to that service.





1. create a nginx deployment and verify it was successfull

   kubectl run nginx --image=nginx -n lab

2. use the command to verify deployment was successfull

   kuectl get deployments -n lab

3. create a service and verify service was successfull

  kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type NodePort

4. Use this command to verify the service was created
  kubectl get services

5. Create a pod that will allow you to query DNS, and verify itâ€™s been created

6. Use the following command to create the busybox pod
   kubectl create -f busybox.yaml

7.Perform a DNS query to the service.
  kubectl exec busybox -- nslookup nginx

8. Record the DNS name.
<service-name>.default.svc.cluster.local






9. create a pod which allow to query DNS nad verify it is been created
   kubectl run tmp-shell --rm -i --tty --image nicolaka/netshoot -- /bin/bash
