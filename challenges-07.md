| **5. Security Breach Attempt**             | A misconfigured IAM policy granted excessive permissions to an external service, raising a security risk.                                              | - Identified permissions via AWS IAM Access Analyzer.<br>- Revoked unnecessary permissions and rotated access keys.<br>- Conducted a security audit to confirm no data compromise.                                                                                              | - Adopted the principle of least privilege for IAM policies.<br>- Integrated AWS Config for monitoring IAM compliance.<br>- Regularly conducted security drills and audits with AWS Security Hub.                                                                     |

## Common Preventive Strategies

| **Strategy**              | **Details**                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automated Monitoring**  | Set up detailed alerts in tools like CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana for early anomaly detection.                                                          |
| **Post-Mortem Analysis**  | Conducted detailed root cause analyses after every incident and maintained a knowledge base for future reference.                                              |
| **Automation**            | Automated repetitive tasks such as scaling, backups, and testing to minimize manual errors.                                                                   |
| **Continuous Training**   | Provided regular training in tools like Kubernetes, Jenkins, and AWS to improve team troubleshooting efficiency.                                               |
| **Test-First Culture**    | Implemented rigorous testing pipelines (unit, integration, and load tests) for all changes in production.                                                       |

By implementing these solutions and preventive measures, a more stable and resilient production environment was achieved.
