|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Integration with Cloud Provider** | Native integration with AWS services like EC2, Lambda, and Route 53.                                                                                | Can be deployed on any cloud or on-premises environment with flexibility to integrate with various services.                                                           |
| **Scalability**                   | Auto-scaling based on AWS ALB's built-in auto-scaling capabilities.                                                                                 | Requires manual configuration for scaling, but supports auto-scaling when deployed on Kubernetes clusters with proper configuration.                                   |
| **Cost**                           | Free to use with AWS ALB, but you pay for ALB usage (traffic, hours, and scaling).                                                                  | Free and open-source, but requires resources for NGINX pods and potential additional licensing costs for advanced features.                                             |
| **Support for HTTP/2 and WebSockets** | Supports HTTP/2 and WebSocket natively.                                                                                                               | Supports HTTP/2 and WebSocket with proper configuration, but needs additional resources like NGINX Plus for some advanced features.                                   |
| **Custom Features**               | Limited to the ALB functionality provided by AWS, such as host/path-based routing, SSL termination, and WebSocket support.                           | Highly customizable with advanced features like rate limiting, request/response rewrites, and more. It provides more control over traffic handling and security.          |
| **SSL/TLS Termination**           | Built-in SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer level.                                                                                           | Supports SSL/TLS termination, but can be configured to do so at different layers (Ingress controller or application).                                                  |
| **Ease of Setup**                 | Simplified setup if running within AWS. Requires minimal configuration for AWS-based applications.                                                 | Requires setting up an NGINX controller and configuration files, which can be complex in certain environments.                                                       |
| **Logging and Monitoring**        | Provides basic monitoring and logging via AWS CloudWatch and ALB logs.                                                                             | Offers detailed logging and monitoring capabilities via integration with Prometheus, Grafana, and various logging tools like Fluentd.                                  |
| **Security**                      | Integrated with AWS security features, including IAM roles, security groups, and WAF (Web Application Firewall).                                     | Flexible security controls, but requires configuration for things like WAF or OAuth. Can be integrated with external security tools.                                  |
| **Community and Support**         | Limited to AWS support and forums.                                                                                                                  | Strong open-source community with contributions, extensive documentation, and support from NGINX.                                                                  |
