| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | What does "Error acquiring the state lock" mean in Terraform? | It means Terraform is trying to access the state file, but itâ€™s currently locked â€” usually due to another active operation or a crash during a previous run. This is common when using remote backends like S3 + DynamoDB for state management. |
| 2 | How do you check if someone else is applying changes in Terraform? | Run `terraform plan`. If the state is locked, you'll get a message indicating which user or process is holding the lock. For AWS backends, check the DynamoDB lock table for the LockID and associated metadata. |
| 3 | How do you resolve a stale state lock in Terraform? | Use `terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>` only after verifying no one is actively modifying infrastructure. You can find the LOCK_ID in the DynamoDB state lock table. |
| 4 | Where can you find the LOCK_ID when using AWS backend? | In the DynamoDB table configured for state locking. Look for entries with `LockID`, user info, and timestamps to determine if the lock is stale. |
| 5 | How can you prevent Terraform state lock issues in CI/CD pipelines? | Implement retry logic for lock errors, split infrastructure into smaller modules for faster applies, and use TTL (Time-To-Live) mechanisms or monitor long-running locks. |
| 6 | What are the best practices for managing Terraform state in production? | - Always use remote backends like AWS S3 + DynamoDB, Azure Storage + Blob Lock, or GCP Cloud Storage + Object Lock. <br> - Avoid using local `terraform.tfstate` files in production. |
| 7 | Why is blindly using `force-unlock` dangerous? | Because if someone is actively applying infrastructure changes, forcibly unlocking can corrupt the state file, cause drift, or lead to inconsistencies. Always verify before unlocking. |
| 8 | How did you resolve a locked state in production? | I first checked the DynamoDB lock table to see who held the lock. Once I confirmed no one was running an active `terraform apply`, I safely ran `terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>`. I also added retry logic in the pipeline and set up Slack alerts for lock-related failures to improve awareness and handling. |

ðŸ’¡ **Practical Tip:** Never use `force-unlock` unless youâ€™ve confirmed there's no active Terraform operation.
