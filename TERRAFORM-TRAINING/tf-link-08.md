1. What if the Terraform state file gets deleted?
   
 Terraform loses track of your infrastructure. <br>
 
 âœ… Always back up state files (use S3 with versioning).
 âœ… Use terraform import if needed to reconnect resources.

ðŸ”¹ 2. How to refactor code without downtime?<br>
 âœ… Use terraform state mv to rename or move resources.
 âœ… Apply changes safely using targeted applies and non-destructive PRs.

ðŸ”¹ 3. What happens if a resource fails during terraform apply?<br>
 Partial deployment can occur.<br>
 âœ… Use terraform apply -target=resource to fix.
 âœ… -refresh-only helps to sync your local state.

ðŸ”¹ 4. How to manage secrets with Terraform?<br>
 âœ… Never hardcode secrets!
 âœ… Integrate Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or SSM Parameter Store.
 âœ… Use sensitive = true for outputs.

ðŸ”¹ 5. What if external changes are made to infrastructure but terraform plan shows no changes?<br>
 Terraform wonâ€™t detect changes automatically.
 âœ… Run terraform refresh.
 âœ… Set up drift detection in CI/CD pipelines.

ðŸ”¹ 6. What if you delete a resource from the Terraform configuration?<br>
 
 Terraform will destroy the resource!
 âœ… Add prevent_destroy = true inside lifecycle block.
 âœ… Or use terraform state rm to safely remove tracking.

ðŸ”¹ 7. What if the cloud provider APIs change?<br>

 Potential compatibility issues.
 âœ… Always use version constraints.
 âœ… Test provider upgrades in lower environments before production.

ðŸ”¹ 8. How to achieve zero-downtime deployments?<br>

 âœ… Use create_before_destroy strategy.
 âœ… Implement blue-green deployments.
 âœ… Monitor resources with health checks.

ðŸ”¹ 9. What happens with circular dependencies?<br>

 Terraform throws dependency errors.
 
 âœ… Refactor using data sources and outputs.
 âœ… Split large modules when needed.

ðŸ”¹ 10. What if you rename a resource in Terraform? <br>

 Terraform will destroy and recreate it by default.
 âœ… Use terraform state mv to safely rename without downtime.

ðŸŒŸ Bonus Pro Tips:

 âœ… Share Terraform modules through versioned Git repositories.<br>
 âœ… Use remote backends like S3 + DynamoDB for team collaboration.<br>
 âœ… Plan safe rollbacks by snapshotting infrastructure.<br>
 âœ… Schedule automated drift detection.<br>
