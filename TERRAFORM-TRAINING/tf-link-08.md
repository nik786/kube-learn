1. What if the Terraform state file gets deleted?
 Terraform loses track of your infrastructure.
 âœ… Always back up state files (use S3 with versioning).
 âœ… Use terraform import if needed to reconnect resources.

ðŸ”¹ 2. How to refactor code without downtime?
 âœ… Use terraform state mv to rename or move resources.
 âœ… Apply changes safely using targeted applies and non-destructive PRs.

ðŸ”¹ 3. What happens if a resource fails during terraform apply?
 Partial deployment can occur.
 âœ… Use terraform apply -target=resource to fix.
 âœ… -refresh-only helps to sync your local state.

ðŸ”¹ 4. How to manage secrets with Terraform?
 âœ… Never hardcode secrets!
 âœ… Integrate Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or SSM Parameter Store.
 âœ… Use sensitive = true for outputs.

ðŸ”¹ 5. What if external changes are made to infrastructure but terraform plan shows no changes?
 Terraform wonâ€™t detect changes automatically.
 âœ… Run terraform refresh.
 âœ… Set up drift detection in CI/CD pipelines.

ðŸ”¹ 6. What if you delete a resource from the Terraform configuration?
 Terraform will destroy the resource!
 âœ… Add prevent_destroy = true inside lifecycle block.
 âœ… Or use terraform state rm to safely remove tracking.

ðŸ”¹ 7. What if the cloud provider APIs change?
 Potential compatibility issues.
 âœ… Always use version constraints.
 âœ… Test provider upgrades in lower environments before production.

ðŸ”¹ 8. How to achieve zero-downtime deployments?
 âœ… Use create_before_destroy strategy.
 âœ… Implement blue-green deployments.
 âœ… Monitor resources with health checks.

ðŸ”¹ 9. What happens with circular dependencies?
 Terraform throws dependency errors.
 âœ… Refactor using data sources and outputs.
 âœ… Split large modules when needed.

ðŸ”¹ 10. What if you rename a resource in Terraform?
 Terraform will destroy and recreate it by default.
 âœ… Use terraform state mv to safely rename without downtime.

ðŸŒŸ Bonus Pro Tips:
 âœ… Share Terraform modules through versioned Git repositories.
 âœ… Use remote backends like S3 + DynamoDB for team collaboration.
 âœ… Plan safe rollbacks by snapshotting infrastructure.
 âœ… Schedule automated drift detection.
