Challenge: Skill Gaps in the Team
Solution: Regularly assess the team’s skill sets and identify gaps in essential areas like Kubernetes, CI/CD, or infrastructure as code (IaC)

Challenge: Resource Allocation and Workload Balance
Solution: To avoid overloading individuals and ensure fair workload distribution, I adopted a workload tracking system with dashboards that provided visibility into task allocations and completion statuses

Challenge: Scaling Infrastructure without Overshooting Budgets
Solution: Managing the cost while scaling was a delicate balance. I addressed this by implementing automated monitoring and alerting tools that tracked infrastructure usage

Challenge: Ensuring Consistency Across Environments
Solution: To ensure consistency, we moved to infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform and Ansible, enabling repeatable deployments across different environments. 
I also established a “golden image” policy for critical software versions and configurations, using version-controlled templates for each environment


Challenge: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline Bottlenecks
Solution: As the number of deployments increased, pipeline performance slowed down. To mitigate this, I streamlined our CI/CD pipelines by 
using parallelization where possible, caching dependencies, and offloading certain stages to other tools


Challenge: High Volume of Production Incidents
Solution: I introduced a robust incident management framework, with automated alerts tied to performance metrics and error rates, enabling the team to quickly identify and address production issues.

Collaboration and Communication Challenges
Challenge: Misalignment between Dev and Ops Teams
Solution: To bridge the gap, I fostered a DevOps culture through joint planning and review sessions, where both Dev and Ops contributed to sprint planning

Optimizing Team Performance and Motivation
Challenge: Keeping the Team Motivated Amid High Pressure
Solution: Working in DevOps often comes with high-stress situations. I prioritized a culture of recognition by celebrating small and big wins alike, creating an environment where everyone felt valued


Challenge: Cross-Training and Career Growth Opportunities
Solution: I promoted a growth-oriented environment by providing cross-training opportunities and allowing team members to rotate roles on different projects. 
This helped everyone develop a holistic skill set and increased the team's flexibility




I led the patching operations for a large-scale environment, managing over 2,000 
containers across the bank's infrastructure and overseeing more than 10 technology centers (TCs). 
I was responsible for generating weekly reports on patching activities, which were submitted to the manager.

I supervised a team of 20 people, including contractors, and facilitated multiple daily meetings, 
such as team and stakeholder discussions. In addition, I coordinated weekly checkpoint 
calls to schedule production deployments with multiple vendors.

We accepted production deployment requests via ServiceNow, handling approximately 
70-80 deployments per month. Our environment included ServiceMesh and Springboard applications. 
Furthermore, I played a key role in creating Jenkins pipeline scripts (Jenkinsfile) for automation.
