| **Challenge**                                   | **Solution**                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Skill Gaps in the Team**                      | Regularly assess the team’s skill sets and identify gaps in essential areas like Kubernetes, CI/CD, or infrastructure as code (IaC).                                                                 |
| **Resource Allocation and Workload Balance**    | Adopted a workload tracking system with dashboards providing visibility into task allocations and completion statuses to avoid overloading individuals and ensure fair distribution.                 |
| **Scaling Infrastructure without Overshooting Budgets** | Implemented automated monitoring and alerting tools to track infrastructure usage, managing cost while scaling infrastructure effectively.                                                       |
| **Ensuring Consistency Across Environments**    | Moved to infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform and Ansible for repeatable deployments. Established a "golden image" policy for critical software versions and configurations, using version-controlled templates. |
| **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline Bottlenecks** | Streamlined CI/CD pipelines by using parallelization, caching dependencies, and offloading certain stages to other tools to improve performance and handle the increased number of deployments.         |
| **High Volume of Production Incidents**         | Introduced a robust incident management framework with automated alerts tied to performance metrics and error rates, enabling quick identification and resolution of production issues.                |
| **Misalignment between Dev and Ops Teams**      | Fostered a DevOps culture through joint planning and review sessions, where both Dev and Ops contributed to sprint planning, improving alignment and collaboration.                                 |
| **Keeping the Team Motivated Amid High Pressure**| Prioritized a culture of recognition by celebrating both small and big wins, creating an environment where everyone felt valued and motivated during high-pressure situations.                      |
| **Cross-Training and Career Growth Opportunities** | Promoted cross-training opportunities and allowed team members to rotate roles on different projects, fostering growth and increasing team flexibility by developing holistic skill sets.             |

I led the patching operations for a large-scale environment, managing over 2,000 
containers across the bank's infrastructure and overseeing more than 10 technology centers (TCs). 
I was responsible for generating weekly reports on patching activities, which were submitted to the manager.

I supervised a team of 20 people, including contractors, and facilitated multiple daily meetings, 
such as team and stakeholder discussions. In addition, I coordinated weekly checkpoint 
calls to schedule production deployments with multiple vendors.

We accepted production deployment requests via ServiceNow, handling approximately 
70-80 deployments per month. Our environment included ServiceMesh and Springboard applications. 
Furthermore, I played a key role in creating Jenkins pipeline scripts (Jenkinsfile) for automation.
