𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐰𝐞 𝐫𝐮𝐧 𝐤𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐥 𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞 𝐩𝐨𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐝? 🤔 

Let's break it down :
✅ With 'kubectl delete pod' action, the pod record in etcd will be updated by the API Server with two different fields "𝒅𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝑻𝒊𝒎𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒎𝒑" and "𝒅𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝑮𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒆𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒐𝒅𝑺𝒆𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒅𝒔"
✅ The endpoint controller checks whether the pod has reached 'terminating state' 
✅ Once the state is reached, it removes the endpoint of the pod from the associated services to prevent external traffic
✅ The endpoint starts getting removed from 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞-𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲, 𝐈𝐏𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬, 𝐈𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬, 𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐃𝐍𝐒 and all other objects that hold endpoint information
✅ 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐭 is notified of the pod being updated (Terminating). 
✅ If the 'preStop' exists, the hook is executed, if not, the kubelet immediately sends a 𝐒𝐈𝐆𝐓𝐄𝐑𝐌 signal to the main container
✅ After waiting for a graceful shutdown period, which is determined by the terminationGracePeriodSeconds and by default is '30' seconds, the container is forcibly stopped.
✅ Finally, the API Server removes the pod from ETCD completely.
