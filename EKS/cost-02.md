# How We Cut Kubernetes Costs by 60% Without Downtime

Cloud costs were skyrocketing, and after a deep dive, we found hidden inefficiencies bleeding our budget.

## 🔥 Top Kubernetes Cost Culprits

| Cost Issue                      | Problem Description |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Idle Workloads**              | Running 24/7 even when not in use. |
| **Over-Provisioned CPU & Memory** | Wasting compute power. |
| **Unoptimized Autoscaling**      | Keeping expensive nodes active unnecessarily. |
| **Orphaned Resources**          | Persistent Volumes, Load Balancers, and Zombie Pods. |
| **Mismanaged Spot Instances**   | Unexpected evictions & higher on-demand costs. |
| **Excessive Network Egress Charges** | High cross-region data transfer costs. |





## 🔍 How We Fixed It & Slashed Costs by 60%

| Optimization Strategy            | Implementation |
|----------------------------------|---------------|
| **Smarter Autoscaling**         | ✅ Replaced Cluster Autoscaler with **Karpenter** (Faster & cost-aware node provisioning). <br> ✅ Used **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** to adjust CPU/memory requests automatically. <br> ✅ Optimized **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** for dynamic scaling. |
| **Scheduled & On-Demand Workloads** | ✅ Used **KEDA** to spin up workloads only when needed. <br> ✅ Moved non-critical workloads to **Argo Workflows** to reduce long-running container costs. <br> ✅ **Paused Dev/Test clusters** after work hours using automation. |
| **Cleaning Up Wasted Resources** | ✅ Ran `kubectl top` & **Kubecost** to find & remove over-provisioned workloads. <br> ✅ Created a **Garbage Collector Controller** to delete: <br> 🔹 Orphaned PVs & PVCs (Saved ~$2,000/month). <br> 🔹 Unused Load Balancers & Ingresses. <br> 🔹 Zombie Services & Stale Helm Releases. |
| **Network Cost Optimization**   | ✅ Reduced **cross-region traffic** by keeping microservices within the same AZ. <br> ✅ Used **Cilium** for service-to-service communication, cutting unnecessary egress charges. <br> ✅ Optimized **Load Balancers** with **Ingress NGINX & Internal LBs** to reduce external traffic costs. |
| **Smarter Spot Instance Management** | ✅ Used **Karpenter** to prioritize Spot Instances while ensuring fallback to On-Demand only when needed. <br> ✅ Implemented **Spot.io Ocean** to dynamically optimize instance type selection for better cost efficiency. |

| **Use Serverless Where Possible**       | Only pay for execution time, not idle.                                                                  | Use **AWS Lambda**, **Step Functions**, and **API Gateway** to reduce costs for event-driven architectures.        |
| **Use Fargate for Containers**          | Avoid paying for unused EC2 compute with container workloads.                                            | Run ECS/EKS containers using **AWS Fargate**, which bills based on CPU and memory consumed per second.            |






| **Aspect**                     | **Argo Workflows**                                                     | **GitLab CI/CD / Jenkins**                                              |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution Model**           | Runs as Kubernetes-native jobs that start and stop as needed.         | Often requires long-running agents or runners, which stay active.      |
| **Resource Usage**            | Uses ephemeral pods; resources are freed once a step completes.       | Runners/agents may stay up even when idle, consuming resources.         |
| **Auto-Scaling**              | Leverages Kubernetes auto-scaling for efficient resource use.         | Needs manual setup or integration for auto-scaling.                    |
| **Billing Efficiency**        | Pay only for the time each pod runs.                                  | May incur extra costs for always-on infrastructure.                    |
| **Container Lifecycle**       | Containers are short-lived and shut down after tasks.                 | Containers (runners/agents) may run continuously.                      |
