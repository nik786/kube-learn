| **Best Practice**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Elasticsearch StatefulSets**  | Deploy Elasticsearch using Kubernetes StatefulSets for stable network identities and persistent storage, ideal for stateful applications. |
| **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**| Automatically adjust the number of Elasticsearch pods based on resource utilization (CPU/memory) to handle varying workloads. |
| **Node Auto-Scaling**               | Configure GKE node pools with auto-scaling to accommodate increased workload as Elasticsearch pods scale up due to HPA.      |
| **Use Headless Services**           | Configure Elasticsearch to use headless services in Kubernetes for internal node discovery and clustering using DNS.          |
| **Resource Requests and Limits**    | Define appropriate resource requests and limits for Elasticsearch pods to ensure intelligent pod placement and resource isolation. |
| **Custom JVM Settings**             | Customize JVM settings for Elasticsearch pods to optimize memory usage and garbage collection for resource-intensive operations. |
| **Monitoring and Scaling Policies** | Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and create scaling policies based on metrics such as cluster load or resource utilization. |
| **Regular Backups and Data Snapshots** | Set up regular backups and use Elasticsearchâ€™s snapshot and restore features for point-in-time backups of indices and configurations. |
| **Security and Access Control**     | Implement authentication and authorization with built-in security features or X-Pack Security, and control access using network policies or firewalls. |
| **Regular Maintenance and Updates** | Keep Elasticsearch and dependencies updated to benefit from bug fixes, improvements, and security patches.                    |
| **Consider Managed Elasticsearch**  | If self-managing Elasticsearch is complex, consider managed services like Elastic Cloud on GKE or other third-party providers. |
