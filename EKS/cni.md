| **Communication Path**        | eBPF-based, efficient in-kernel routing.                              | Uses ENIs, may route via NAT/gateway.                               | IP routing via iptables or eBPF.                                    | Overlay network using VXLAN.                                        | IPVS/LVS-based routing within the cluster.                        | Routes via SR-IOV, VLAN, or VxLANâ€”multi-network aware.            |
| **Egress Cost Optimization**  | Minimizes egress by keeping traffic in-cluster or on-node.            | Possible egress charges for cross-AZ/VPC traffic.                   | Similar to VPC unless tuned for IP preservation.                    | Higher overhead; more chance of egress costs in overlays.          | Keeps traffic within the cluster; good cost efficiency.           | Can reduce egress by using optimized network paths.               |
| **Data Path Efficiency**      | Very efficient (bypasses kernel stack using eBPF).                    | Moderate; depends on ENI/IP handling.                               | Good with eBPF; slower with iptables.                              | Lower performance due to user-space and overlays.                  | High-speed kernel routing (IPVS) provides good efficiency.        | Depends on underlying NICs (e.g., SR-IOV can be very efficient). |
| **NAT & SNAT Avoidance**      | Avoids SNAT with identity-aware routing.                              | SNAT often required for inter-VPC or cross-AZ.                      | SNAT common unless explicitly configured.                          | Uses NAT heavily in overlay networks.                              | Typically avoids NAT using internal routing.                      | Flexible NAT policies; can avoid SNAT depending on mode.          |
| **Scalability & Cost Impact** | Scales efficiently with fewer IPs and ENIs; eBPF is lightweight.       | Limited by ENI/IP allocations; can increase instance size/cost.     | IP exhaustion can be an issue; needs tuning for large clusters.    | Less scalable; overlays increase latency and resource usage.       | Scales well; kernel-level forwarding is resource-efficient.       | Scales with hardware; complex but efficient in high-throughput.   |

| **Technology Base**     | Uses eBPF (kernel-level) for fast and efficient networking and security.   | Uses IPVS for routing, iptables for network policy, and BGP for routing.    |
| **Performance**         | High performance with low latency due to kernel bypass (eBPF).              | Good performance using kernel networking stack (IPVS), but not as fast as eBPF. |
| **Security Features**   | Advanced security policies with identity-aware filtering and visibility.    | Basic Kubernetes network policies; lacks deep inspection or identity layers. |
| **Observability**       | Built-in tools like Hubble for real-time visibility and monitoring.         | Limited built-in observability; requires external tools.                    |
