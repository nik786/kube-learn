| **Communication Path**        | eBPF-based, efficient in-kernel routing.                              | Uses ENIs, may route via NAT/gateway.                               | IP routing via iptables or eBPF.                                    | Hybrid of Calico + Flannel: overlay routing with policy control.    | Overlay network using VXLAN.                                        | IPVS/LVS-based routing within the cluster.                        | Routes via SR-IOV, VLAN, or VxLAN—multi-network aware.            |
| **Egress Cost Optimization**  | Minimizes egress by keeping traffic in-cluster or on-node.            | Possible egress charges for cross-AZ/VPC traffic.                   | Similar to VPC unless tuned for IP preservation.                    | Similar to Weave/Flannel overlays; more egress if not tuned.        | Higher overhead; more chance of egress costs in overlays.          | Keeps traffic within the cluster; good cost efficiency.           | Can reduce egress by using optimized network paths.               |
| **Data Path Efficiency**      | Very efficient (bypasses kernel stack using eBPF).                    | Moderate; depends on ENI/IP handling.                               | Good with eBPF; slower with iptables.                              | Slightly better than Weave; policy engine adds overhead.             | Lower performance due to user-space and overlays.                  | High-speed kernel routing (IPVS) provides good efficiency.        | Depends on underlying NICs (e.g., SR-IOV can be very efficient). |
| **NAT & SNAT Avoidance**      | Avoids SNAT with identity-aware routing.                              | SNAT often required for inter-VPC or cross-AZ.                      | SNAT common unless explicitly configured.                          | Uses NAT by default; requires custom config to disable SNAT.         | Uses NAT heavily in overlay networks.                              | Typically avoids NAT using internal routing.                      | Flexible NAT policies; can avoid SNAT depending on mode.          |
| **Scalability & Cost Impact** | Scales efficiently with fewer IPs and ENIs; eBPF is lightweight.       | Limited by ENI/IP allocations; can increase instance size/cost.     | IP exhaustion can be an issue; needs tuning for large clusters.    | Scales decently; Flannel-based overlays need tuning.                 | Less scalable; overlays increase latency and resource usage.       | Scales well; kernel-level forwarding is resource-efficient.       | Scales with hardware; complex but efficient in high-throughput.   |
| **Networking Mode**           | Native Linux + eBPF                                                   | VPC-native                                                            | Policy-based + Routing (BGP or no encaps)                          | Overlay (Flannel) with Calico policy engine                         | Overlay                                                              | Kernel routing (no overlay)                                       | Multiple: SR-IOV / VLAN / Overlay                                 |
| **Encap/BGP/Overlay**         | No overlay; eBPF replaces traditional encaps/BGP                      | No overlay; VPC native IPs                                           | BGP (no encap) or VXLAN (encap mode)                               | Uses VXLAN overlay (via Flannel), optionally with BGP                | Uses VXLAN (Overlay with NAT)                                       | No overlay; uses IP routing & IPVS                                | Supports SR-IOV, VxLAN (overlay), VLAN                            |
| **Performance**               | **High** – Kernel bypass with eBPF = lower latency, high throughput. | Medium – depends on ENI scaling and IP management.                  | Medium–High with BGP/no encap; slower with iptables.               | Medium – Overlay + policy adds some latency.                         | **Low–Medium** – User-space & overlay adds latency.                | High – Kernel routing + IPVS efficient.                           | High – SR-IOV based paths are near-native speed.                  |
| **IP Exhaustion**             | **Low** – Efficient IP reuse, no dependency on secondary IPs.         | **High** – Limited by available ENIs/IPs in VPC subnets.            | Medium – Can lead to IP exhaustion without tuning.                 | Medium – Needs tuning for large cluster IP pools.                    | Medium – Overlay can hide IP exhaustion but affects scalability.   | Low – Does not consume external IPs unnecessarily.               | Low – Hardware level segmentation; IPs assigned per NIC.          |

| **Technology Base**     | Uses eBPF (kernel-level) for fast and efficient networking and security.   | Uses IPVS for routing, iptables for network policy, and BGP for routing.    |
| **Performance**         | High performance with low latency due to kernel bypass (eBPF).              | Good performance using kernel networking stack (IPVS), but not as fast as eBPF. |
| **Security Features**   | Advanced security policies with identity-aware filtering and visibility.    | Basic Kubernetes network policies; lacks deep inspection or identity layers. |
| **Observability**       | Built-in tools like Hubble for real-time visibility and monitoring.         | Limited built-in observability; requires external tools.                    |
