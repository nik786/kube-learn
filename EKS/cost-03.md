# 💰 **How to Cut AWS Costs by 40% Without Sacrificing Performance**  

Many AWS workloads are **overprovisioned**, leading to unnecessary costs. **Optimizing AWS resource usage** can reduce costs by **40%** without affecting performance.

## 🔹 **Key AWS Cost Optimization Strategies**  

| **Category** | **Optimization Strategies** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| **Rightsizing EC2 & RDS Instances** 🖥️ | 🔹 Use **AWS Compute Optimizer** to analyze underutilized EC2 instances. <br> 🔹 Switch from **t3.large to t3.medium**, saving **30%** on compute costs. <br> 🔹 Move workloads to **Graviton2 instances**, reducing cost by **20%**. |
| **Leveraging Auto Scaling & Spot Instances** 📈 | 🔹 Implement **EC2 Auto Scaling Groups** to match demand dynamically. <br> 🔹 Use **Spot Instances** for non-critical workloads, cutting compute costs by **70%**. <br> 🔹 Configure **AWS Auto Scaling cooldowns** to prevent unnecessary scaling events. |
| **Optimizing AWS Lambda & API Gateway Costs** ⚡ | 🔹 Adjust **Lambda memory configurations** to optimize execution time. <br> 🔹 **Cache API responses** using API Gateway with CloudFront, reducing **Lambda invocations by 60%**. <br> 🔹 Use **Provisioned Concurrency** only where absolutely needed to avoid cold start costs. |
| **Cleaning Up Unused Resources** 🧹 | 🔹 Identify **idle EBS volumes & unused snapshots** using AWS Trusted Advisor. <br> 🔹 Implement **lifecycle policies for S3 & logs**, archiving old data to **S3 Glacier**. <br> 🔹 Decommission **unused load balancers** and optimize networking to reduce **data transfer costs**. |
