What is Three-Tier Architecture?

Three-tier architecture divides the application into three logical layers:

Presentation Tier â€“ User interface (UI), often the web/mobile frontend.

Application (Logic) Tier â€“ Backend business logic and API handling.

Data Tier â€“ Databases and caching systems that store and manage data.


# Three-Tier Architecture Mapping

| Tier                    | Services Used                                                       | Role / Responsibility                                                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Presentation Tier**   | Amazon S3 + CloudFront                                               | Hosts the React frontend and serves it globally via CDN             |
|                         | Amazon Route 53                                                      | DNS resolution for frontend URLs                                    |
|                         | API Gateway                                                          | Exposes API endpoints to frontend securely                          |
| **Application Tier**    | API Gateway + VPC Link + ALB                                         | Routes and balances traffic into ECS services                       |
|                         | Amazon ECS (Node.js Backend)                                         | Hosts business logic and handles API requests                       |
| **Data Tier**           | Amazon RDS                                                           | Stores relational (structured) data                                 |
|                         | Amazon DynamoDB                                                     | Stores NoSQL (unstructured or semi-structured) data                 |
|                         | Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)                                           | Speeds up data access via in-memory caching                         |

> ðŸ§© This architecture enables **scalability, modularity, and separation of concerns**. Each tier can be scaled or secured independently.


# Applying AWS 6 Pillars to Three-Tier Architecture

| Pillar          | Applied To (Tier)         | Best Practices / Strategies                                                                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**     | All Tiers                 | - Use IAM roles & policies with least privilege<br>- Enable encryption (S3, RDS, DynamoDB, Redis)<br>- Use WAF & Shield for ALB/API Gateway |
| **Reliability**  | Application & Data Tier   | - Use ALB with ECS for high availability<br>- RDS Multi-AZ deployment<br>- Use health checks and Auto Scaling |
| **Performance**  | All Tiers                 | - CloudFront for global frontend delivery<br>- Use Redis (ElastiCache) for low-latency access<br>- Use Graviton2 for ECS tasks (if compatible) |
| **Cost**         | All Tiers                 | - Use S3 lifecycle rules for frontend assets<br>- DynamoDB on-demand or provisioned with auto-scaling<br>- Spot Instances for ECS where feasible |
| **Operational Excellence** | All Tiers     | - Enable CloudWatch Logs and Metrics<br>- Use Systems Manager for config and patching<br>- CI/CD with CodePipeline or GitHub Actions |
| **Sustainability** | All Tiers              | - Use serverless where possible (e.g., Lambda)<br>- Use managed services (API Gateway, DynamoDB)<br>- Right-size compute and storage resources |
