## Benefits of Using ALB Ingress and NGINX Ingress Together in EKS

| Category             | Benefit                                                                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Traffic Management** | ALB handles external traffic efficiently; NGINX manages complex routing within the cluster |
| **IP Management**      | ALB provides public-facing IPs; NGINX uses internal IPs behind the ALB to reduce exposure |
| **Latency**            | ALB terminates TLS early at the edge; NGINX can reduce in-cluster routing latency with smart rules |
| **Throughput**         | Load can be balanced between ALB and multiple NGINX pods, enabling horizontal scale       |
| **Costing**            | ALB reduces cost for external traffic; NGINX handles internal traffic without expensive LoadBalancers |
| **Security**           | ALB supports AWS WAF, Shield, and Cognito; NGINX enables mTLS, IP whitelisting, and RBAC |
| **Scalability**        | ALB scales automatically with traffic; NGINX can autoscale with HPA or Karpenter          |
| **Ingress Use Case**   | Public apps use ALB; internal services or advanced routing use NGINX                      |
| **Routing Control**    | Use ALB for basic host/path-based routing; NGINX supports regex, rewrites, header routing |
| **High Availability**  | Dual ingress controllers offer redundancy and fault isolation                            |
| **Compliance & Audit** | ALB logs go to CloudWatch/S3; NGINX logs can be shipped to centralized logging stacks     |
| **Performance Tuning** | NGINX supports fine-tuning like caching, gzip, and connection reuse                      |
| **Security Policies**  | ALB integrates with IAM/WAF; NGINX enforces pod-level controls via OPA/Kyverno            |
