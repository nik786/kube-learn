|                        | Skip tests on feature/dev branches                                        | Saves time when full testing isnâ€™t needed                                  | Maven: `-DskipTests` <br> Gradle: `-x test`                                                   |

|                        | Use lightweight `Jenkinsfile`                                             | Avoid heavy scripting and plugins                                          | Use Declarative syntax: `pipeline { agent any ... }`                                         |

What factors affect the execution time of your CI/CD pipeline?
----------------------------------------------------------------



| **Factor**                         | **Explanation**                                                                                       | **Solution**                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pipeline Complexity**           | More stages, steps, and scripts increase execution time.                                              | Simplify pipeline logic; modularize workflows; avoid redundant steps.                             |
| **Build Size**                    | Large applications or images take longer to compile or package.                                       | Split builds into microservices; optimize build process and artifacts.                            |
| **Test Suite Duration**           | Extensive or unoptimized tests can significantly slow down the pipeline.                              | Run unit tests in parallel; tag and run only affected test suites (test selection).               |
| **Dependency Management**         | Fetching many or large dependencies (e.g., npm, Maven) adds time.                                     | Cache dependencies; use lock files; avoid unnecessary package installs.                           |
| **Container/Image Pull Time**     | Pulling large Docker images or from slow registries increases duration.                               | Use smaller base images (Alpine); maintain internal registries; pre-pull images on agents.        |
| **Resource Availability**         | Limited or underpowered CI agents/runners slow down execution.                                        | Use scalable cloud runners; allocate enough CPU/RAM to CI nodes.                                 |
| **Network Latency**               | Affects pulling/pushing artifacts, accessing external APIs or repos.                                  | Use local mirrors; reduce remote dependencies; run in same region as artifacts/registries.        |
| **Caching Strategy**              | Poor or no caching of dependencies/artifacts increases rebuild times.                                 | Enable smart caching for build artifacts, test results, and dependencies.                         |
| **Parallelization**               | Lack of parallel execution for independent steps results in longer total time.                        | Use matrix builds; run jobs/stages in parallel when possible.                                     |
| **Code Quality/Structure**        | Monolithic or poorly structured codebases may lead to slower builds and tests.                        | Refactor into smaller modules/services; adopt a clean architecture.                               |



 Explain the Jenkins Workflow and its key stages
 -------------------------------------------------

| **Stage**             | **Description**                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Source Code Management (SCM)** | Jenkins connects to a source control system (e.g., Git, GitHub, Bitbucket) to pull the latest code.         |
| **2. Triggering Build**            | A build is triggered by events like code commits, scheduled cron jobs, or manual execution.                  |
| **3. Build Stage**                 | Jenkins compiles the source code, resolves dependencies, and builds artifacts or packages.                   |
| **4. Test Stage**                  | Automated tests (unit, integration, etc.) are run to validate code quality and functionality.                |
| **5. Code Analysis**               | Tools like SonarQube or Checkstyle analyze the code for issues, code smells, and vulnerabilities.           |
| **6. Artifact Archiving**          | Build artifacts (e.g., JARs, Docker images) are archived or uploaded to repositories like Nexus, Artifactory.|
| **7. Deployment Stage**           | The application is deployed to a dev, staging, or production environment using tools like Ansible, Helm, etc.|
| **8. Post-Build Actions**          | Notifications (Slack, email), cleanup, reports, or further triggers are executed after the build completes. |
