# Git Branching Strategies in Our Organization

We use a structured Git branching strategy to support collaboration and continuous integration:

## Main Branches
- **`main`:** 
  - Stable production-ready code.
  - Protected from direct commits.
- **`develop`:** 
  - Integration branch for feature development.

## Feature Branches
- Created from `develop` for new features.
- Naming convention: `feature/feature-name`.
- Merged back into `develop` after code reviews and testing.

## Bugfix and Hotfix Branches
- **Bugfix:**
  - For non-critical bugs in the `develop` branch.
  - Naming convention: `bugfix/issue-description`.
- **Hotfix:**
  - For critical production issues.
  - Naming convention: `hotfix/issue-description`.
  - Merged into both `main` and `develop`.

## Release Branches
- Created from `develop` for release preparation.
- Naming convention: `release/version-number`.
- Used for final testing and adjustments before merging into `main`.

## Code Reviews and CI Checks
- Merge requests with mandatory code reviews.
- Automated tests and checks must pass before merging.

This branching strategy enables organized development, efficient collaboration, and smooth releases.
