Scenario: You are tasked with designing a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture 
for a critical application on AWS. 
How would you leverage AWS services such as Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, 
and Multi-AZ deployments to achieve high availability and resilience?


To design a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture for a critical application on AWS, 
leveraging services such as Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and Multi-AZ deployments is crucial. 
Here's how you can utilize these services to achieve high availability and resilience:

| **Aspect**                          | **Solution/Implementation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**    | - Deploy ELB to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances or containers in different Availability Zones (AZs).<br>- Use ALB or NLB for advanced routing and load balancing.<br>- Configure health checks to route traffic away from unhealthy instances. |
| **Auto Scaling**                    | - Set up Auto Scaling groups to dynamically scale the number of instances or containers based on demand.<br>- Define scaling policies to adjust capacity according to traffic patterns.<br>- Distribute instances across multiple AZs for fault tolerance. |
| **Multi-AZ Deployments**            | - Deploy components and databases across multiple AZs for high availability and fault tolerance.<br>- Use RDS Multi-AZ deployments for seamless failover.<br>- Design app components to handle failover and switch to standby resources if needed. |
| **Data Replication and Backup**    | - Implement data replication strategies for durability (e.g., using S3, RDS, or DynamoDB with replication).<br>- Take snapshots and backups of critical data for disaster recovery.                                                       |
| **High Availability Patterns**      | - Use active-active or active-passive configurations to distribute workloads across regions.<br>- Implement AWS Global Accelerator or Route 53 failover routing for automatic traffic redirection in case of an outage.                      |
| **Monitoring and Alerting**         | - Set up CloudWatch for key performance metrics, resource utilization, and anomaly detection.<br>- Configure alarms for automated actions or notifications in case of performance degradation or failures.                                       |



Scenario: Your development team is adopting a microservices architecture for a new project on AWS. 
How would you design a scalable and resilient infrastructure to support microservices deployment,
communication, and monitoring?


| **Aspect**                         | **Solution/Implementation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
