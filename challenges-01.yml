Resource Management and Scaling
Challenge:
Unexpected traffic spikes caused performance degradation due to inadequate resource allocation.

Resolution:

Configured Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
Utilized KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) for scaling based on custom metrics like queue length in Amazon SQS or Kafka.
Prevention:

Implemented detailed resource requests and limits for pods.
Regular load testing to predict scaling requirements under different conditions.


Observability and Monitoring
Challenge:
Lack of centralized logging and monitoring made it difficult to troubleshoot production issues.

Resolution:

Set up a centralized logging system using Elasticsearch, Fluent Bit, and Kibana (EFK).
Integrated Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring cluster and application metrics.
Used AWS CloudWatch Container Insights for additional insights into EKS metrics.
Prevention:

Standardized logging formats for easier indexing and analysis.
Created proactive alerting rules in Prometheus and CloudWatch to detect anomalies early.


Cluster Upgrades and Compatibility
Challenge:
Cluster upgrades disrupted services due to incompatibility between Kubernetes versions and application dependencies.

Resolution:

Tested upgrades in a staging environment using a replica of the production cluster.
Followed a phased upgrade strategy to minimize impact.
Prevention:

Created detailed upgrade playbooks and documentation.
Regularly educated the team on Kubernetes deprecations and changes.



7. Cost Management
Challenge:
High costs due to unused resources and inefficient scaling configurations.

Resolution:

Enabled cluster auto-scaling and cleaned up unused resources regularly.
Monitored costs using AWS Cost Explorer and implemented tag-based resource tracking.
Prevention:

Scheduled non-essential workloads to scale down during off-peak hours.
Used AWS Savings Plans and Reserved Instances to optimize long-term costs.




Deployment Rollbacks
Challenge:
Failed deployments caused downtime due to lack of rollback strategies.

Resolution:

Implemented Helm rollback for quick restoration of previous states.
Used blue-green and canary deployment strategies for safer rollouts.
Prevention:

Automated rollback processes in CI/CD pipelines.
Conducted regular drills to ensure rollback procedures were well-documented and efficient.
