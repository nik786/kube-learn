Too many engineers assume that DevOps means: CI/CD pipelines.

Nah. It's so much more than that.

DevOps includes:

Automated SSL Certificate Rotation

Secret Management (e.g., Vault, SOPS)

Canary Deployments with Progressive Rollouts

Autoscaling with Metrics-Driven Policies

Immutable Infrastructure with Blue-Green Deployments

Debugging with Distributed Tracing

Cluster Autoscaler Tuning for Workload Spikes

Self-Healing Infrastructure (e.g., Health Checks & Restart Policies)

GitOps with Advanced Reconciliation Loops

Service Mesh Implementations (e.g., mTLS, Traffic Shaping)

I could go on...

Operating tools is not Devops - just a part of it.

Be open minded - learning becomes easy.
