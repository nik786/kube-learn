Too many engineers assume that DevOps means: CI/CD pipelines.

Nah. It's so much more than that.

DevOps includes:

Automated SSL Certificate Rotation

Secret Management (e.g., Vault, SOPS)

Canary Deployments with Progressive Rollouts

Autoscaling with Metrics-Driven Policies

Immutable Infrastructure with Blue-Green Deployments

Debugging with Distributed Tracing

Cluster Autoscaler Tuning for Workload Spikes

Self-Healing Infrastructure (e.g., Health Checks & Restart Policies)

GitOps with Advanced Reconciliation Loops

Service Mesh Implementations (e.g., mTLS, Traffic Shaping)

I could go on...

Operating tools is not Devops - just a part of it.

Be open minded - learning becomes easy.

How I saw Cloud Engineer's life 10 years ago:

- You need multiple cloud certifications to be taken seriously.
- The more tools you master, the better cloud engineer you become.
- Automating everything is the only way to scale.
- Success means constantly pushing yourself to the limits.
- Infrastructure means knowing every command in Linux.
- Cloud architecture is all about uptime and performance.

What I learned after working for almost a decade:

- Certifications help, but real-world experience speaks louder.
- Mastering fewer tools but understanding them deeply is key.
- Knowing when not to automate can save you from unnecessary complexity.
- Work-life balance keeps your performance sustainable.
- Networking and systems knowledge matter more than just commands.
- Cloud architecture is about balancing performance, security, and cost.

It's about mastering the basics and staying adaptable.

Adding `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` and `sessionAffinity: ClientIP` enhances performance by
reducing latency and ensuring client sessions stick to the same pod.
