Question 6: Name three important DevOps KPIs.



# Three Important DevOps KPIs

| **KPI**                    | **Description**                                                                                       | **Importance**                                                                                         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deployment Frequency**    | Measures how often new code is deployed to production.                                                | Indicates development agility; higher frequency suggests efficient pipelines and rapid feature delivery. |
| **Lead Time for Changes**   | Time from code commit to production deployment.                                                      | Shorter lead times reflect streamlined workflows and faster value delivery.                           |
| **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** | Average time to recover from production failures.                                                  | Highlights system resilience; lower MTTR minimizes downtime impact.                                  |
