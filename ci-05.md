# Three Important DevOps KPIs

1. **Deployment Frequency:**
   - **Description:** Measures how often new code is deployed to production.
   - **Importance:** Indicates development agility; higher frequency suggests efficient pipelines and rapid feature delivery.

2. **Lead Time for Changes:**
   - **Description:** Time from code commit to production deployment.
   - **Importance:** Shorter lead times reflect streamlined workflows and faster value delivery.

3. **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):**
   - **Description:** Average time to recover from production failures.
   - **Importance:** Highlights system resilience; lower MTTR minimizes downtime impact.
