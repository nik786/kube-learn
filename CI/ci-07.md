Question 8: How do you define branching strategies in your organization?

We use a structured Git branching strategy to support collaboration and continuous integration:

# Branching Strategy

| **Branch Type**       | **Description**                                                                                          | **Naming Convention**             | **Merge Details**                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **`main`**            | Stable production-ready code. Protected from direct commits.                                              | -                                 | Direct commits are not allowed.                   |
| **`develop`**         | Integration branch for feature development.                                                               | -                                 | Merged into from feature branches for integration. |
| **Feature Branches**  | Created from `develop` for new feature development.                                                       | `feature/feature-name`            | Merged back into `develop` after code reviews.     |
| **Bugfix Branches**   | For non-critical bugs in the `develop` branch.                                                           | `bugfix/issue-description`        | Merged into `develop` after bug resolution.        |
| **Hotfix Branches**   | For critical production issues.                                                                           | `hotfix/issue-description`        | Merged into both `main` and `develop`.             |
| **Release Branches**  | Created from `develop` for release preparation and final testing.                                         | `release/version-number`          | Merged into `main` after final testing.            |

## Code Reviews and CI Checks
- Merge requests with mandatory code reviews.
- Automated tests and checks must pass before merging.

This branching strategy enables organized development, efficient collaboration, and smooth releases.
