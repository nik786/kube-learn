Question 13: How many environments are you maintaining?


# Environments Maintained for Development Lifecycle

| **Environment**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Development Environment**  | Used by developers for local coding and initial testing.                        |
| **2. Integration/Testing Environment** | Serves as a shared space for integrating code and running integration tests. |
| **3. Staging Environment**      | Mirrors production for final testing and user acceptance testing (UAT).        |
| **4. Production Environment**   | Hosts the live application accessible to end-users.                            |
| **5. Disaster Recovery Environment** | Provides a backup to ensure business continuity.                              |
| **6. Performance Testing Environment** | Dedicated to load and stress testing.                                        |

**Total Environments Maintained:** Six

Maintaining these environments ensures thorough testing and smooth deployment processes, leading to high-quality software delivery.




Question 14: What types of deployments do you follow in your project?

# Deployment Strategies

| **Strategy**                | **Description**                                                                                   | **Benefits**                       |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Blue-Green Deployments**   | Maintain two identical environments (Blue and Green). Deploy new versions to the idle environment and switch traffic upon validation. | Zero downtime, easy rollback      |
| **Canary Deployments**       | Gradually roll out new versions to a subset of users. Monitor performance before full-scale release. | Risk mitigation, real user testing |
| **Rolling Deployments**      | Update instances incrementally without taking the system offline.                                | No downtime, issues detected without impacting all users |
| **Recreate Deployments**     | Recreate all instances of the application during deployment, shutting down old versions before bringing up new ones. | Simplicity, quick to implement    |

## Implementation

- **Automation**: Use CI/CD tools for automated deployments.
- **Containerization**: Leverage Docker and Kubernetes for efficient resource utilization.
- **Monitoring**: Use Prometheus and Grafana for performance tracking.

These strategies enable us to deliver updates efficiently while minimizing risks and downtime.
