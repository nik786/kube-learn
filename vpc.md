Domain: Design Secure Architectures
Your organization already had a VPC(10.10.0.0/16) setup with one public(10.10.1.0/24) and two private subnets - private subnet 1 (10.10.2.0/24) and private subnet 2 (10.10.3.0/24). 
The public subnet has the main route table, and two private subnets have two different route tables respectively. AWS sysops team reports a problem starting the EC2 instance 
in private subnet 1 cannot communicate to the RDS MySQL database on private subnet 2. What are the possible reasons?
