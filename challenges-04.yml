Migrating an application to an EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster requires gathering detailed information from the customer to ensure a smooth transition. Below is a categorized list of information to collect:

1. Application Information
Application Architecture:

Type of application (e.g., monolithic, microservices).
Number of services/components and their dependencies.
APIs and their interactions (internal and external).
Use of Stateful or Stateless services.
Resource Requirements:

CPU, memory, and storage requirements per service.
Expected traffic load (e.g., request per second, peak load).
Data storage needs (e.g., persistent volumes, object storage).
Dependencies:

Third-party services (e.g., databases, APIs, external systems).
Language runtimes and frameworks (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js).
Existing CI/CD pipelines and tools in use.
Configuration:

Environment variables, secrets, and configuration files.
Hard-coded dependencies or parameters.
Current Hosting Environment:

Existing infrastructure details (e.g., EC2, on-premise, other cloud providers).
Networking setup (e.g., subnets, security groups, DNS).
2. Security Requirements
Authentication & Authorization:

Methods for user authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth, IAM).
Role-based access control (RBAC) needs.
Secrets Management:

Current mechanism for storing secrets (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
Compliance Requirements:

Compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Security policies and audits.
3. Data Management
Databases:

Type of database (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB, NoSQL, on-prem).
Migration requirements for database data.
Backup and recovery policies.
Storage:

Persistent storage needs (e.g., EBS, EFS, S3).
Existing storage mechanisms and data migration strategy.
4. Networking and Communication
Networking Details:

VPC configuration (e.g., subnets, availability zones).
Firewall and security group settings.
DNS and Ingress:

Existing domain configuration and DNS records.
Load balancing needs (e.g., ALB, NLB).
Inter-Service Communication:

Protocols in use (e.g., HTTP, gRPC, REST).
Service discovery requirements.
5. Monitoring and Logging
Current Monitoring Setup:

Tools in use (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, CloudWatch).
Metrics to monitor (e.g., CPU usage, latency).
Logging:

Centralized logging solutions (e.g., ELK, Loki).
Log retention policies.
6. CI/CD Pipelines
Existing Pipelines:

Tools in use (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions).
Artifacts and registry details (e.g., Docker images, Helm charts).
Deployment Strategy:

Current deployment method (e.g., rolling updates, blue-green).
Desired deployment strategies in EKS.
7. Compliance and Policies
Governance:

Organizational policies for cloud usage.
Approval workflows.
Audit Requirements:

Logging and reporting needs for audits.
8. Future Scalability
Growth Projections:

Anticipated growth in users, traffic, or data.
Scaling needs (horizontal/vertical scaling).
Auto-scaling:

Current or desired auto-scaling mechanisms.
9. Training and Support
Team Knowledge:

Current teamâ€™s familiarity with Kubernetes and EKS.
Training requirements for Kubernetes.
Support Expectations:

Expectations for ongoing support post-migration.
Tools and dashboards for developers and operators.
10. Migration Goals and Timeline
Objectives:

Primary goals for migration (e.g., scalability, cost optimization).
Features to prioritize during migration.
Timeline:

Expected deadlines for migration phases.
11. Risk Assessment
Current Pain Points:
Known bottlenecks or issues with the current setup.
Risk Tolerance:
Acceptance of downtime, data loss risk, or cost fluctuations during migration.
Output of Collected Information
Once all the necessary data is collected:

Create a migration plan covering architecture design, resource allocation, and a rollback strategy.
Design Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests for application deployment.
Implement CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployments.
Test in a staging EKS cluster before production rollout.
